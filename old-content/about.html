<h1>Who are you again?</h1>

<p>
  I'm a senior engineering manager at <a
    href="https://github.com/about/careers/">GitHub</a>.  I manage the Semantic
  Code team, which applies academic programming language theory to analyze all
  of the code hosted on GitHub.  Our goal is to make it easier for developers
  and maintainers to understand what their code does, and how other developers
  use it.
</p>

<p>
  In the past I've also been involved in low-level performance, reliability, and
  security analysis of network traffic.  As part of that work, I'm the co-editor
  of two draft W3C specifications: <a
    href="https://w3c.github.io/reporting/">Reporting</a> and <a
    href="https://w3c.github.io/network-error-logging"/>Network Error
    Logging</a> (NEL).
</p>

<p>
  And above all else, I want to teach the world how to use formal methods to
  solve real problems.
</p>

<p>
  How's that for a grab bag of interests?
