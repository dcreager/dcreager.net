      The early 2000's saw several research groups look into distributed hash
      tables as a decentralized way to structure a distributed system. In this
      talk, I'll briefly describe some of the history behind DHTs, and look at
      one of them in particular: Pastry, which takes into account how close or
      far apart nodes are from each other when constructing the peer-to-peer
      overlay network. We'll also look at Scribe, which implements
      anycast/multicast messaging on top of the Pastry overlay network.
