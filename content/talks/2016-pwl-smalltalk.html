      Smalltalk is one of the earliest object-oriented languages. It's extremely
      influential — many of the OO concepts that we use in today's languages
      were first developed in Smalltalk. But what influenced Smalltalk? Alan Kay
      will walk us through the language's inspirations in this talk, including
      such crazy new technologies as UIs with overlapping windows and a
      1970's-era ur-tablet!
