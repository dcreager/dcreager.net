      <p>
      GitHub has recently added Code Navigation features (jump to definition and
      find all references) that let you navigate code directly on <a
        href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.  For the languages that we
      support, we extract and store symbol information for every named branch
      and tag, of every repository, public or private, with no configuration
      necessary. The compute and storage requirements to do this for all of the
      code on GitHub are quite large. In this talk, we'll discuss some of the
      trade-offs we've made to make this tractable at GitHub's scale, to be able
      to operate and monitor this service effectively, and to let us add support
      for new languages quickly and easily. We'll also talk about our ongoing
      work to extend Code Navigation to handle links that cross package and
      repository boundaries.
