      Your application depends on the network more than you might realize.  Are
      you monitoring it?  A performance problem in the network is a performance
      problem for your app.  A reliability problem in the network is a
      reliability problem for your app.

      <p>
      At Google, we have instrumented several parts of our serving stack to
      collect detailed information about the network.  An important part of that
      is a real-time pipeline for collecting and analyzing packet captures,
      which give you detailed diagnostics about individual network connections.
      In this talk you'll learn how to visualize and analyze packet captures to
      detect network problems that affect what your users experience.
