      Exploring a large or unfamiliar codebase can be tricky. Code Navigation
      features like “jump to definition” and “find all references” let you
      discover how different pieces of code relate to each other. To power these
      features, we need to extract lists of symbols from the code, and describe
      the language-specific rules for how those symbols relate to each other.
      </p>

      <p>
      It’s difficult to add Code Nav to a large hosted service like GitHub,
      where we must support hundreds of programming languages, hundreds of
      millions of repositories, and petabytes of history. At this scale, we have
      a different set of design constraints than a local IDE. We need our data
      extraction to be incremental, so that we can reuse previous results for
      files that haven’t changed in a newly pushed commit, saving both compute
      and storage costs. And to support cross-repo lookups, it should require
      zero configuration — repo owners should not have to set up anything
      manually to activate the feature.
      </p>

      <p>
      In this talk I’ll describe stack graphs, which use a graphical notation to
      define the name binding rules for a programming language. They work
      equally well for dynamic languages like Python and JavaScript, and for
      static languages like Go and Java. Our solution is fast — processing most
      commits within seconds of us receiving your push. It does not require
      setting up a CI job, or tapping into a project-specific build process. And
      it is open-source, building on the tree-sitter project’s existing
      ecosystem of language tools.
