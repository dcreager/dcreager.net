      As a programmer, you probably have a favorite programming language — the
      one that you’re most familiar with, that you “think natively” in when
      coding. If you’re lucky enough to use that language at
      <code>$DAY_JOB</code>, you might not have had the time or inclination to
      explore other languages. But doing so can be illuminating! In this talk,
      we’ll dive into several different languages, exploring how they promote
      different ways of thinking about and solving problems. Even if you don’t
      end up using those other languages in anger, learning how they work can
      make you a better programmer in your “native tongue”.
