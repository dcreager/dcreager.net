      Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) was first described by Tony Hoare
      in 1978.  Since then, there have been two main "branches" of further
      development.  In the first branch, CSP inspired how concurrency is handled
      in an ongoing series of programming languages — most recently (and
      famously) in Go.  In the second branch, CSP was refined into a rigorous
      “process calculus”, and has since been used to formally prove various
      safety and liveness properties of concurrent and distributed systems.

      <p>
      This talk will be a whirlwind history of CSP, a high-level overview of the
      process calculus, and some live demos of using a refinement checker to
      prove things about interesting systems.  (No proving things by hand!)
