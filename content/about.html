<h1>Who are you again?</h1>

<h2>Short professional bio</h2>

<p>
  Douglas Creager is a software engineer at <a
    href="http://www.google.com/about/careers/">Google</a>.  He has a <a
    href="/publications/012-dphil-thesis/">PhD</a> in Computing from the <a
    href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>, and an <a
    href="/publications/001-meng-thesis/">MEng</a> from the <a
    href="http://web.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>.  His
  research focuses on infrastructure support and programming techniques for
  analyzing truly huge volumes of data.  During his MIT years, he helped develop
  initial versions of the <a href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/">Open
    Microscopy Environment</a>, a system for biologists to manage and analyze
  microscope images.  At Oxford, he was a member of the <a
    href="http://www.softeng.ox.ac.uk/">Software Engineering Programme</a>, and
  helped teach and develop curricula for their part-time MSc for professional
  software engineers.  Before joining Google, he was the Vice President of
  Research and Development at <a href="http://www.redjack.com/">RedJack,
    LLC</a>, a network analytics startup in Washington, DC.  Before that, he was
  a consultant at <a href="http://www.abinitio.com/">Ab Initio Software</a>,
  working on large-scale data analysis applications in the finance and telecoms
  industries.

<h2>Slightly longer personal bio</h2>

<p>
  I live in the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts.  I am a huge fan (and season
  ticket holder) of the <a href="http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/">Boston Red
    Sox</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I lived in sunny Oxford, England for three years while researching
  for my DPhil.  While there, I was a member
  of <a href="http://www.linacre.ox.ac.uk/">Linacre College</a>,
  played for Corpus-Linacre MCR football team, attended pub quiz
  weekly at the Cricketer's Arms, and ate far too many meals at Bodrum
  Kebab House.
</p>

<p>
  Working backwards, I was at MIT for seven years before heading off
  to Oxford: five of those getting my SB and MEng degrees, and two as
  a post-Masters researcher.  Even though I was (and am) a computer
  scientist, I did my research in the Department of Biology, as a
  member of the <a href="http://sorger.med.harvard.edu/">Sorger
  Lab</a>, which has since moved across the river to Harvard Medical.
  I was also a member of the <a href="http://zetapsi.mit.edu/">Rho
  Alpha chapter</a> of the <a href="http://www.zetapsi.org/">Zeta Psi
  Fraternity</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Before MIT, I spent my formative years living in Minnesota and North
  Carolina, though my family is originally from the mountains of East
  Tennessee.  This gives me a somewhat schizophrenic view of college
  sports, as I cheer for the Gophers in hockey, the Volunteers in
  football, and the Blue Devils in basketball.
