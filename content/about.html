<h1>Who are you again?</h1>

<p>
  I'm a software engineer at <a
    href="http://www.google.com/about/careers/">Google</a>.  I work on the
  Internetto team, helping to analyze a stupendously large network for
  performance and reliability problems.  I want to teach the world how to use
  formal methods to solve real problems.  And I love thinking about how
  programming languages are designed, implemented, and used.

<p>
  How's that for a grab bag of interests?
