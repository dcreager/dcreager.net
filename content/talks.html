      Your application depends on the network more than you might realize.  Are
      you monitoring it?  A performance problem in the network is a performance
      problem for your app.  A reliability problem in the network is a
      reliability problem for your app.
      </p>

      <p>
      At Google, we have instrumented several parts of our serving stack to
      collect detailed information about the network.  An important part of that
      is a real-time pipeline for collecting and analyzing packet captures,
      which give you detailed diagnostics about individual network connections.
      In this talk you'll learn how to visualize and analyze packet captures to
      detect network problems that affect what your users experience.

      Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) was first described by Tony Hoare
      in 1978.  Since then, there have been two main "branches" of further
      development.  In the first branch, CSP inspired how concurrency is handled
      in an ongoing series of programming languages — most recently (and
      famously) in Go.  In the second branch, CSP was refined into a rigorous
      “process calculus”, and has since been used to formally prove various
      safety and liveness properties of concurrent and distributed systems.
      </p>

      <p>
      This talk will be a whirlwind history of CSP, a high-level overview of the
      process calculus, and some live demos of using a refinement checker to
      prove things about interesting systems.  (No proving things by hand!)

      History! Those who don't know it are doomed to etc.
      </p>

      <p>
      Smalltalk is one of the earliest object-oriented languages. It's extremely
      influential — many of the OO concepts that we use in today's languages
      were first developed in Smalltalk. But what influenced Smalltalk? Alan Kay
      will walk us through the language's inspirations in this talk, including
      such crazy new technologies as UIs with overlapping windows and a
      1970's-era ur-tablet!
