## Abstract

Modern software systems place a large emphasis on heterogeneous
communication.  For disparate applications to communicate effectively,
a generic theory of data is required that works at the
*inter-application* level.  The key feature of such a theory is *full
generality*, where the data model of an application is not restricted
to any particular modeling formalism.  Existing solutions do not have
this property: while any data can be encoded in terms of XML or using
the Semantic Web, such representations provide only *basic
generality*, whereby to reason about an arbitrary application's data
model it must be re-expressed using the formalism in question.  In
this paper we present a theory of data which is fully generic and
utilizes an extensible design to allow the underlying formalisms to be
incorporated into a specification only when necessary.  We then show
how this theory can be used to investigate two common data equivalence
problems — canonicalization and transformation — independently of the
datatypes involved.
