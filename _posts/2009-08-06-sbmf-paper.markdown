# SBMF07 paper chosen for extended proceedings

My SBMF07 [paper](/publications/014-csp-algorithm-study/), “Empirical
analysis and optimization of an NP-hard algorithm using CSP and FDR,”
was chosen to appear in the conference's extended proceedings.  The
extended proceedings will be published in a forthcoming issue of
ENTCS.  Huzzah!

The paper originally was extracted from Chapter 8 of my [D.Phil
thesis](/publications/012-dphil-thesis/), and I had to cut out a bit
of detail in order to make the space requirements for the conference
paper.  Luckily, the extended proceedings allow for a longer paper, so
I was able to add most of the cut parts back in.  So the version that
will appear in ENTCS is, for the most part, identical to the
corresponding chapter from my thesis.
