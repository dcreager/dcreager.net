  <li>Load in a description of the \(Spec\) and \(Impl\) processes,
transforming them each into a <strong>labeled transition system (LTS)</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="/hst/semantic-methods/">previous post</a>, we’re going to rely on
the <em>labeled transition system</em> defined by CSP’s <em>operational semantics</em> to
represent processes in our refinement checker.  An LTS is just a directed graph,
with nodes representing processes and subprocesses, and edges representing
events.  In this post, we’ll look at LTSes in a bit more detail, and at how best
to represent them in code.</p>

<h4 id="its-just-a-state-machine">It’s just a state machine</h4>

<p>As a simple example, let’s say that we have an event, called
\(\texttt{done}\), and a bunch of “items”, such as the integers 1, 2, and 3.
We want to construct a process that fires the \(\texttt{done}\) event exactly
once for each item, in any order.</p>

<p>CSP processes can be parameterized, so a good first stab is to keep track of
which items are <strong>not</strong> done yet:</p>

<p>\[
\textrm{Done}(\textit{remaining}) =
  \texttt{done}\,?\textit{item} : \textit{remaining}
  \rightarrow
  \textrm{Done}(\textit{remaining} \setminus \{ \textit{item} \})
\]</p>

<p>The \(\textit{remaining}\) parameter gives us the set of items that we
<strong>haven’t</strong> fired a \(\texttt{done}\) event for.  The
\(\texttt{done}\,?\textit{item} : \textit{remaining}\) clause lets the
environment choose any of these remaining items, allowing the
\(\texttt{done}\) event for that item to occur.  We then remove that item from
the set and repeat.  (The \(?\) handles the base case of this recursion for
us; if \(\textit{remaining}\) is empty, then the whole process definition
becomes \(\textrm{STOP}\).)</p>

<p>If we plug in a particular value for \(\textit{remaining}\), we can use the
rules from the algebraic semantics to get a simplified definition:</p>

<p>\[
\textrm{Done}(\{1,2,3\}) = {} \\
  \quad \texttt{done}{.}1 \rightarrow \textrm{Done}(\{2,3\}) \\
  \qquad \Box \\
  \quad \texttt{done}{.}2 \rightarrow \textrm{Done}(\{1,3\}) \\
  \qquad \Box \\
  \quad \texttt{done}{.}3 \rightarrow \textrm{Done}(\{1,2\})
\]</p>

<p>If we repeatedly expand the definitions for every process we encounter, we’ll
end up with a separate instance of the \(\textrm{Done}\) process for each
possible subset of \(\{1,2,3\}\).</p>

<p>Moreover, we can construct an LTS for these processes.  There will be a node for
each \(\textrm{Done}\) process that we encountered, and an edge for each
event that we followed, during the expansion:</p>

<picture><source media="(max-width: 511px)" srcset="/media/images/csp/done3.tall.png" /><source media="(min-width: 2048pw)" srcset="/media/images/csp/done3.large.png" /><img src="/media/images/csp/done3.png" class="figure" /></picture>

<p>An important feature of CSP’s operational semantics is that <strong>every</strong>
well-defined CSP process can be described by some LTS.  For our refinement
algorithm, our question then becomes how to represent these LTS graphs in code.</p>

<h4 id="the-nave-approach">The naïve approach</h4>

<p>The simplest answer would be to store the LTS graph directly.  You wouldn’t even
have to write very much code, since you can find a decent pre-canned graph
library for just about any programming language you can think of.  You’d walk
through the operational semantics rules of the process’s description, creating
explicit nodes and edges in the graph for each subprocess and transition.</p>

<p>This approach has some real advantages.  First off, it’s conceptually simple:
there’s a physical graph edge in memory for each transition rule describe by the
operational semantics.  Second, if you choose a good graph representation, an
explicit LTS can be very dense, memory-efficient, and cache-friendly.</p>

<p>However, there is also one very large drawback: CSP processes can get very big,
especially once you start using the parallel composition operators.  And by
“big”, I mean “large enough to exhaust your physical memory”.  This is the
“state space explosion” problem that is the bane of any exhaustive formal model
checking technique.</p>

<p>Revisiting our example from above, we saw that the LTS for
\(\textrm{Done}(\{1,2,3\})\) had 8 processes in it.  The LTS for
\(\textrm{Done}(\{1,2,3,4\})\) is twice as large:</p>

<picture><source media="(max-width: 511px)" srcset="/media/images/csp/done4.tall.png" /><source media="(min-width: 2048pw)" srcset="/media/images/csp/done4.large.png" /><img src="/media/images/csp/done4.png" class="figure" /></picture>

<p>Because of how we’ve chosen to use a set as our state parameter, the LTS for any
\(\textrm{Done}\) process is going to have \(O(2^n)\) nodes in it, where
\(n\) is the number of possible elements in the set.  This kind of exponential
growth is the worst thing you can run across when figuring out how much memory
you’re going to need!  If we need to keep track of 10 items, our LTS is already
going to require a <em>thousand</em> distinct nodes.  With 20 items, a <em>million</em> nodes.
With 30 items, a <em>billion</em> nodes.  With 40 items, a <em>trillion</em> nodes.  Even if
we have a super-efficient graph library at our disposal, which can represent
each node in a graph using a <em>single</em> byte of memory, we’d need over a
<strong>terabyte</strong> to represent the LTS for that 40-item \(\textrm{Done}\) process.</p>

<p>Tracking 40 items is not an outrageous request, but our process definition gives
us something that we can’t possibly load into memory at once.  We want to avoid
creating a full LTS in advance for a large process like this, <em>especially</em> if we
don’t need to analyze every subprocess to determine whether a particular
refinement check holds.  This puts us in a bit of a pickle: we want to avoid
explicitly creating the full LTS graph of a process, but we still need walk
through that LTS graph as part of a refinement check.</p>

<h4 id="laziness-to-the-rescue">Laziness to the rescue!</h4>

<p>To get around this problem, we need to implement some kind of <strong>laziness</strong>.
Instead of storing the LTS directly, we store a “recipe” for constructing the
LTS on the fly, as we need it.</p>

<p>We can implement laziness in a number of different ways.  Roscoe spends several
pages describing FDR’s approach: “supercompilation”.  Briefly, supercompilation
defines an internal language (almost like a bytecode) that can be used to encode
the operational semantics rules of each CSP operator.</p>

<p>In HST, we’re going to take a different approach.  Instead of using something
like a bytecode to represent the transition rules, we’re going to use code
itself, using two common object-oriented patterns: <strong>interfaces</strong> and
<strong>visitors</strong>.  For each CSP operator, we’ll implement the following interface:</p>

<pre class="CodeRay"><code><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="class">Process</span> {
    <span class="directive">virtual</span> <span class="directive">void</span> initials(std::function&lt;<span class="directive">void</span>(Event)&gt; op) <span class="directive">const</span> = <span class="integer">0</span>;

    <span class="directive">virtual</span> <span class="directive">void</span>
    afters(Event initial, std::function&lt;<span class="directive">void</span>(<span class="directive">const</span> Process&amp;)&gt; op) <span class="directive">const</span> = <span class="integer">0</span>;
};
</code></pre>

<p>(Did I tell you that I’m implementing HST in C++?  Don’t run away!  I promise it
won’t be bad!)</p>

<p>This interface tells us for each operator, we need to be able to calculate the
process’s <strong>initials</strong> — that is, the set of events that it can perform.  And,
given one particular initial event, we also need to be able to calculate the
<strong>afters</strong> for that event — that is, the set of processes that you end up in if
you follow that event.  (If you have any nondeterminism in your process, it’s
definitely possible for there to multiple processes you might end up in; when
the environment chooses this event, it’s undefined which of those processes you
actually end up in.)</p>

<p>The rules of the operational semantics give us all of the information that we
need to implement these two methods for every CSP operator, and all of the other
tasks that we need to perform during a refinement check can be implemented in
terms of these two methods.  And most importantly, we never instantiate a
subprocess until it’s referenced in some <code>after</code> method.  All together, this
gives us the right tradeoff between simplicity, flexibility, and control over
our memory usage.</p>
