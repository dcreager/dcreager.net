          <h1>S₀, the “assembly language”</h1>
          <p class="prev"><a href="/swanson/execution-model/">Execution model</a></p>
          <p>In the <a href="../execution-model/">previous post</a>, we talked about Swanson’s execution
model, but didn’t really describe what Swanson code <em>looks like</em>.  In this post,
we’ll look at S₀ (pronounced “ess naught”), which is Swanson’s “assembly
language”.</p>

<div class="aside">
  <p>As we’ll see, S₀ hews pretty closely to the Swanson execution model, and isn’t
really a language that you’ll want to program in directly.  Typically, you’ll
actually <em>write</em> in some other higher-level language, which will be translated
into S₀.  We’ll see in later posts how this process works.  For now, don’t be
put off by the amount of boilerplate that you see here — it’s not something that
you’ll have to author directly!</p>
</div>

<h3 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h3>

<p>We’ve carefully designed the concrete syntax of S₀ so that it is as simple to
parse as possible — for instance, without requiring a particular parser
generator.  (The reference implementation is a simple recursive descent parser
that only requires a single character of lookahead.)  In fact, it’s more
important for S₀ to be easy to parse, than for it to be easy for humans to
write.  After all, you will very rarely have to write S₀ directly!</p>

<p>This simplicity is important since the first part of writing a new Swanson host
is being able to load in “bootstrap” code, which is written in S₀.  This part of
the host will need to be written directly in the host’s language, and so we want
to make that host-specific custom code as simple to write as possible.</p>

<h3 id="names">Names</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the previous post, Swanson names are <em>binary</em>.  There are three
ways to encode a Swanson name in S₀.</p>

<p>The first allows us to encode arbitrary binary content, written in hexadecimal
within square brackets.  Each octet in the name must be written with two
hexadecimal characters, and there must be one or more whitespace characters in
between each octet.  For instance, the following is one way to encode the name
<code>name</code>:</p>

<pre>
[6e 61 6d 65]
</pre>

<p>The second notation is a shortcut syntax for names that are ASCII-encoded
strings, since there are enough higher-level languages that use ASCII to encode
their identifiers.  A <strong><em>bare name</em></strong> is an ASCII-encoded name that only
consists of common identifier characters: in particular, alphanumerics,
underscore, period, at-sign (<code>@</code>), and dollar sign (<code>$</code>).  (Bare names cannot
contain whitespace, any other printable characters, or <em>any</em> non-printable
characters.)  A bare name can be written in S₀ directly:</p>

<pre>
$_    entry      atom       i        ds.hashmap
$0    entry@1    literal    while    primitives.bool
</pre>

<div class="aside">
  <p>You might wonder why <code>@</code> and <code>$</code> are considered bare name characters, since
most programming languages limit identifiers to alphanumberic characters.
(Lisps that allow <code>kebab-case</code> names are an exception!)</p>

  <p>And that’s actually the reason why!  Since S₀ is a translation target for other
languages, having a couple of atypical characters available lets us more easily
construct “derived” Swanson names that cannot conflict with names that appear in
the source languages.</p>
</div>

<p>The final notation is a syntax for names that are ASCII-encoded strings, but
don’t consist of <em>only</em> bare name characters.  If a name contains only ASCII
printable characters, you can enclose them in double-quotes:</p>

<pre>
"entry"               "kebab-case-with-&gt;arrows"
"name with spaces"    "name:with:colons"
</pre>

<p>Note that there are no escape sequences for this notation — which means in
particular that you can’t use this notation if the name contains a double-quote
character.  If it does, you have to use the hex notation described above.</p>

<h3 id="modules-and-blocks">Modules and blocks</h3>

<p>S₀ code is organized into <em>modules</em>.  Each module consists of a number of
<em>blocks</em>, each of which has a distinct name.  Blocks are used in <em>closures</em>,
which are Swanson invokables whose branches are implemented in S₀.</p>

<pre>
module test {
  $load: containing () receiving ($loaded) {
    $module = atom;
    -&gt; $loaded;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Each block starts with <code>containing</code> and <code>receiving</code> clauses, which define which
names are available in the environment at the start of the block.  The names in
the <code>containing</code> clause are part of the block’s “closure set” — they represent
values that are moved “into” the closure when it’s created.  The names in the
<code>receiving</code> clause are the “inputs” of the block — the caller must ensure that
the environment contains exactly these names when invoking the block’s closure.
When a block is invoked, its closure and input environments are merged together
before execution proceeds — which means that the block’s <code>containing</code> and
<code>receiving</code> clauses can’t have any names in common.</p>

<p>Each block also contains a <em>body</em>, enclosed in curly braces.  The body consists
of zero or more <em>statements</em> followed by exactly one <em>invocation</em>.</p>

<h3 id="statements">Statements</h3>

<p>There are four kinds of statement in S₀:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create atom</strong>: Creates a new Swanson atom distinct from all others, and adds
it to the environment:</p>

    <pre>
dest = atom;
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create literal</strong>: Creates a new Swanson literal, and adds it to the
environment:</p>

    <pre>
dest = literal [6e 61 6d 65];
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create closure</strong>: Creates a new S₀ closure, and adds it to the environment:</p>

    <pre>
dest = closure containing (value1, value2)
  branch true = true_branch,
  branch false = false_branch;
</pre>

    <p>The statement has a <code>containing</code> clause which <strong><em>removes</em></strong> the specified
values from the environment, moving them into the new closure.  Each branch of
the closure has a name (<code>true</code>, <code>false</code>), and refers to one of the blocks in
the enclosing module (<code>true_branch</code>, <code>false_branch</code>).  The <code>containing</code> clause
of each of those blocks must match the <code>containing</code> clause of the <em>create
closure</em> statement.</p>

    <p>There is a shortcut syntax for when the new closure has a single branch, with
an empty name:</p>

    <pre>
dest = closure containing (value1, value2) -&gt; block;
</pre>

    <p>is exactly equivalent to:</p>

    <pre>
dest = closure containing (value1, value2)
  branch [] = block;
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rename</strong>: Changes the name of a value in the environment:</p>

    <pre>
dest = rename source;
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For all of these statements, it’s an error if there’s already a value in the
environment with the desired “destination” name.  For create closure and rename
statements, it’s an error if there <em>isn’t</em> already a value in the environment
with the desired “source” name.</p>

<p>And that’s it!  You’ll notice that you can’t really do anything interesting with
S₀ statements.  They’re just used to set up the environment as needed for the
block’s invocation, which is where real computation happens.</p>

<h3 id="invocations">Invocations</h3>

<p>Each ends with <strong><em>exactly one</em></strong> invocation:</p>

<pre>
-&gt; value branch;
</pre>

<p>This <em>removes</em> the value named <code>value</code> from the environment, and passes control
to its branch named <code>branch</code>.  (It’s an error if there’s no value in the
environment named <code>value</code>, or if that value isn’t an invokable, or if that
invokable doesn’t have a branch named <code>branch</code>.)</p>

<p>There’s a shortcut syntax for invoking a branch with an empty name:</p>

<pre>
-&gt; value;
</pre>

<p>Whatever values are still in the environment (after removing the invokable that
we’re about to pass control to) are provided to the invokable as its inputs.  If
the invokable is an S₀ closure, then the <code>receiving</code> clause of the selected
branch’s block must match the set of names that are in the environment that are
about to be provided as input.</p>

<h3 id="s-modules-as-swanson-units">S₀ modules as Swanson units</h3>

<p>S₀ modules can be used as Swanson units.  The module has a name, which is also
used as the name of the unit.  The first block in the module is its <em>loader
block</em>, which is invoked to load the unit.  The loader block’s <code>containing</code> set
must be empty.</p>

<p>The loader block’s <code>receiving</code> set defines the dependencies of the unit.  Each
name is treated as the name of some other Swanson unit.  The host will load
those dependencies, and put them into the environment as inputs before invoking
the loader block (just like for the <code>receiving</code> set of any other block).</p>

<p>The input named <code>$loaded</code> is handled specially.  Instead of loading a unit named
<code>$loaded</code> as a dependency, the host provides a special invokable for this input,
which the loader block will invoke with the “value” of the module (as an output
named <code>$module</code>).  Our example module from up above is a Swanson unit that
produces a new atom when loaded:</p>

<pre>
module test {
  $load: containing () receiving ($loaded) {
    $module = atom;
    -&gt; $loaded;
  }
}
</pre>

<h3 id="a-larger-example">A larger example</h3>

<p>Putting it all together, this is an example module that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>is an entry point (that is, the <code>main</code> module of a program)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>depends on another (primitive) unit named <code>primitive.bool</code>, which contains
some routines for dealing with booleans,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>creates a <code>true</code> constant,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evaluates the constant,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and then quits.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<pre>
module bool.can_evaluate_true {
  $load: containing () receiving ($loaded, primitive.bool) {
    $module = closure containing (primitive.bool) -&gt; main;
    -&gt; $loaded;
  }

  main: containing (primitive.bool) receiving ($finish) {
    $return = closure containing ($finish) -&gt; main@1;
    -&gt; primitive.bool true;
  }

  main@1: containing ($finish) receiving ($_, $0) {
    primitive.bool = rename $_;
    value = rename $0;
    $return = closure containing ($finish, value) -&gt; main@2;
    -&gt; primitive.bool drop;
  }

  main@2: containing ($finish, value) receiving () {
    $evaluate = closure containing ($finish)
      branch true = main@2$$evaluate$true,
      branch false = main@2$$evaluate$false;
    -&gt; value evaluate;
  }

  main@2$$evaluate$true: containing ($finish) receiving () {
    -&gt; $finish succeed;
  }

  main@2$$evaluate$false: containing ($finish) receiving () {
    -&gt; $finish fail;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Can you see why this isn’t a language that you’d want to program in directly?
In the next post, we’ll learn about S₁, which provides some helpful syntactic
sugar, while still being a very low-level language.</p>
