          <h1>S₁ for bootstrapping</h1>
          <p class="prev"><a href="/swanson/s0/">S₀, the “assembly language”</a></p>
          <p>In the <a href="../s0/">previous post</a>, we described S₀, and showed how it would be
<strong><em>absolutely disgusting</em></strong> to have to program in it directly.  Which is why I
described it as Swanson’s “assembly language”.  In this post, we’ll look into
exactly <em>how</em> the language is complicated, and use that to describe a <em>slightly</em>
better language named S₁.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-way-too-complex">This is way too complex</h3>

<p>Let’s dig into that some more!  Here’s an incredibly simple bit of code:</p>

<pre>6 + 4 * 3</pre>

<p>It’s not even a statement or function, it’s just an expression!  But even this
example will be quite complex in S₀, for a few reasons that combine together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First off, as we described in previous posts, <em>every</em> useful bit of
computation must be modeled by <em>invoking</em> some <em>invokable</em>.  In this example,
it’s not just the addition and the multiplication.  We also have an invocation
each time we load in an integer constant!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, there is no nesting of operations.  That means we have to separate out
all of the invocations into a single list, figure out the correct order to
execute them in, and possibly introduce temporary values for the results of
subexpressions.  (This is exactly what you have to do with all high level
languages, when you interpret them or compile them down into something lower
level like LLVM IR or proper assembly.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lastly, each block in S₀ must contain <em>exactly one</em> invocation.  In most
languages (including assembly!), there’s implicit control flow from one
instruction to the next.  That doesn’t exist in S₀!  Instead, S₀ uses
<em>continuation passing style</em>, where you have to create separate top-level
“blocks” for each step of your computation, and manually thread them together
using continuation parameters.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The end result of all of this means that the S₀ version of our example looks
something like:</p>

<pre>
module horrible_example {
  $load:
    containing ()
    receiving ($loaded, primitive.int)
  {
    $module = closure containing (primitive.int) -&gt; main;
    -&gt; $loaded;
  }

  main:
    containing (primitive.int)
    receiving ($finish)
  {
    value = literal "4";
    $return = closure containing ($finish) -&gt; main@1;
    -&gt; primitive.int from_literal;
  }

  main@1:
    containing ($finish)
    receiving ($_, $0)
  {
    primitive.int = rename $_;
    four = rename $0;
    value = literal "3";
    $return = closure containing ($finish, four) -&gt; main@2;
    -&gt; primitive.int from_literal;
  }

  main@2:
    containing ($finish, four)
    receiving ($_, $0)
  {
    primitive.int = rename $_;
    three = rename $0;
    $return = closure containing ($finish, primitive.int) -&gt; main@3;
    rhs = rename three;
    -&gt; four "*";
  }

  main@3:
    containing ($finish, primitive.int)
    receiving ($_)
  {
    twelve = rename $_;
    value = literal "6";
    $return = closure containing ($finish, twelve) -&gt; main@4;
    -&gt; primitive.int from_literal;
  }

  main@4:
    containing ($finish, twelve)
    receiving ($_, $0)
  {
    primitive.int = rename $_;
    six = rename $0;
    $return = closure containing ($finish, six, twelve) -&gt; main@5;
    -&gt; primitive.int drop;
  }

  main@5:
    containing ($finish, six, twelve)
    receiving ()
  {
    $return = closure containing ($finish) -&gt; main@6;
    rhs = rename twelve;
    -&gt; six "+";
  }

  main@6:
    containing ($finish)
    receiving ($_)
  {
    eighteen = rename $_;
    $return = closure containing ($finish) -&gt; main@7;
    -&gt; eighteen drop;
  }

  main@7:
    containing ($finish)
    receiving ($_)
  {
    -&gt; $finish succeed;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Hopefully you can piece together how this faithfully implements our simple
arithmetic expression:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There are invocations of <code>primitive.int</code> <code>from_literal</code> to load in each of our
integer constants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are invocations of <code>*</code> and <code>+</code> operations to actually perform the math.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We introduce some temporaries, and invoke everything in the right order, to
produce the correct result, 18.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>But not without complexity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the invocations take in an additional input parameter named <code>$return</code>,
which is the continuation that control should pass to after the operation is
done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each <code>$return</code> value is a closure, defined by an S₀ block, which “closes over”
any of the values currently in the environment that <em>aren’t</em> inputs to the
invokable that we’re about to invoke.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each continuation block uses its <code>receiving</code> clause to indicate what outputs
it expects to receive from the invokable that passes control to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several of the invokables produce an additional <code>$_</code> output, which “returns
back” the invokable that we just called.  This is how we can invoke
<code>primitive.int</code> <code>from_literal</code> several times, for instance, even though
Swanson’s linearity means that each of those invocations should technically
consume the <code>primitive.int</code> value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We make copious use of <code>rename</code> statements to allow us to give meaningful
names to our temporaries, without having to be constrained by the names of the
inputs and outputs expected by each of the invokables.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to explicitly invoke <code>drop</code> methods whenever we’re done with any
value.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="s-is-ever-so-slightly-better">S₁ is ever so slightly better</h3>

<p>What does this example look like in S₁?</p>

<pre>
module horrible_example {
  $load:
    containing ()
    receiving ($loaded, primitive.int)
  {
    $module = closure containing (primitive.int) -&gt; main;
    $loaded();
  }

  main:
    containing (primitive.int)
    receiving ($finish)
  {
    value = literal "4";
    primitive.int-&gt;from_literal(value) -&gt; ($0 -&gt; four);
    value = literal "3";
    primitive.int-&gt;from_literal(value) -&gt; ($0 -&gt; three);
    four~&gt;"*"(rhs &lt;- three) -&gt; ($_ -&gt; twelve);
    value = literal "6";
    primitive.int-&gt;from_literal(value) -&gt; ($0 -&gt; six);
    primitive.int~&gt;drop();
    six~&gt;"+"(rhs &lt;- twelve) -&gt; ($_ -&gt; eighteen);
    eighteen~&gt;drop();
    $finish~&gt;succeed();
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Note that we’ve only “solved” one of the three complexities that we mentioned
above.  We’ve added back in “implicit control flow”, so that we don’t have to
manually extract each step of our computation into top-level blocks.  But we
still model <em>every</em> operation as an invocation of some invokable, and we still
have no nesting of operations.  But it’s still a substantial improvement!</p>

<p>The overall structure of the code is largely the same: you’ve got a module,
containing a number of blocks, each of which consists of some operations.  But
whereas in S₀, a block consists of zero or more <em>statements</em> followed by exactly
one <em>invocation</em>, an S₁ block consists of an arbitrary list of <em>statements</em> and
<em>calls</em>.  The only restriction is that an S₁ block must end with a call.</p>

<h4 id="s-calls">S₁ calls</h4>

<p>This call expression is the meat of S₁.  Looking carefully, there are two
variants, depending on whether you use <code>-&gt;</code> or <code>~&gt;</code>.  The <code>-&gt;</code> variant desugars
into the <code>~&gt;</code> variant, so let’s look at the <code>~&gt;</code> version first:</p>

<pre>
six~&gt;"+"(rhs &lt;- twelve) -&gt; ($_ -&gt; eighteen);
</pre>

<p>This call gets “translated” into an S₀ invocation, along with some additional
support statements.  In this case, we’re invoking the <code>+</code> branch of the value
named <code>six</code> in the current environment.</p>

<p>The call contains what look like parameter and return value lists.  The <code>(rhs &lt;-
twelve)</code> part tells us that <code>six</code> <code>+</code> expects an input value named <code>rhs</code> — but
that the name of that input value in our environment is currently <code>twelve</code>, and
so we’ll need to <code>rename</code> it before the invocation.</p>

<p>Similarly, the <code>($_ -&gt; eighteen)</code> tells us that <code>six</code> <code>+</code> will produce an output
named <code>$_</code> — but that we’d rather call that output value <code>eighteen</code> in the rest
of our code, and so we’ll need another <code>rename</code> <em>after</em> the invocation.</p>

<p>Most importantly, though, because this call is <em>not</em> the last operation in the
S₁ block, we will automatically extract everything <em>after</em> this call into a new
continuation block, and add it as an additional input value named <code>$return</code>.
(<code>$return</code> is the default name for the continuation parameter; it’s not
mentioned explicitly.  There is additional syntax that gives you more control
over how the continuation is passed in to the invocation, but we’ll ignore that
for now.)</p>

<p>Altogether, this S₁ call gets translated into the following S₀, where the
<code>CLOSURE</code> part is automatically determined by whatever values are in the
environment at the time of the call, but not mentioned as an input.</p>

<pre>
    $return = closure containing (CLOSURE) -&gt; main@6;
    rhs = rename twelve;
    -&gt; six "+";
  }

  main@6:
    containing (CLOSURE)
    receiving ($_)
  {
    eighteen = rename $_;
</pre>

<h4 id="reuse-calls">“Reuse” calls</h4>

<p>As we mentioned above, <em>many</em> invokables use an output named <code>$_</code> to “return
themselves back” to caller, as a way of getting around Swanson’s linearity.
This is a common enough pattern that we’ve added syntactic sugar to S₁ to handle
it.  A call that uses <code>-&gt;</code> will automatically add an extra <em>output</em> that renames
<code>$_</code> back to the name that it had before the call.  That is, the following two
calls are exactly equivalent:</p>

<pre>
primitive.int-&gt;from_literal(value) -&gt; ($0 -&gt; four);
</pre>
<pre>
primitive.int~&gt;from_literal(value) -&gt; ($_ -&gt; primitive.int, $0 -&gt; four);
</pre>

<h3 id="whats-the-point">What’s the point?</h3>

<p>While S₁ is certainly “better” than S₀ — in that it’s less actively painful to
program in it directly as a human — you might still be wondering why you’d
subject yourself to it.  In the <a href="../intro/">introduction</a> I mentioned that Swanson is a
language <em>framework</em>, which we intend to compile or translate other higher level
languages into.  If that’s the case, why do we have this language that’s still
so low level, instead of jumping straight to the higher level languages that are
actually pleasant to use?</p>

<p>The main reason is that this gives us a better story for <em>bootstrapping</em>.
Another goal of the framework is to work with arbitrary <em>host environments</em>,
while requiring as little as possible of those hosts.  The only hard and fast
rule is that a host needs to be able to parse and execute S₀ code.  Some
primitives will need to be provided by the host, but we want to minimize the
number of primitives that each host needs to implement directly.  As much as
possible, we want the core “standard library” of Swanson code to be written in
some way that (a) doesn’t require each host to reimplement it, and (b) doesn’t
“bless” any one particular higher level language (or its standard library) as
the one that all other hosts have to depend on.</p>

<p>S₁ is intended to serve this role.  One single host environment (the “bootstrap
environment”) will need to implement an S₁ parser and translator <em>directly</em>.
That bootstrap environment can produce S₀ translations of any “standard library”
code written in S₁.  And every other host environment will then have access to
that code, while requiring nothing more than an S₀ parser and a small set of
primitives.</p>

<p>That’s the vision, at least!</p>
