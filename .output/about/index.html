<h2>Short professional bio</h2>

<p>
  Douglas Creager is the Vice President of Research and Development
  at <a href="http://www.redjack.com/">RedJack, LLC</a>, a network
  analytics startup in Washington, DC.  He has
  a <a href="/publications/012-dphil-thesis/">PhD</a> in Computing
  from the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>,
  and an <a href="/publications/001-meng-thesis/">MEng</a> from
  the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology</a>.  His research focuses on infrastructure support and
  programming techniques for analyzing truly huge volumes of data.
  During his MIT years, he helped develop initial versions of
  the <a href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/">Open Microscopy
  Environment</a>, a system for biologists to manage and analyze
  microscope images.  At Oxford, he was a member of
  the <a href="http://www.softeng.ox.ac.uk/">Software Engineering
  Programme</a>, and helped teach and develop curricula for their
  part-time MSc for professional software engineers.  Before coming to
  RedJack, he was a consultant
  at <a href="http://www.abinitio.com/">Ab Initio Software</a>,
  working on large-scale data analysis applications in the finance and
  telecoms industries.  At RedJack, he brings his extensive data
  analysis expertise to help advance the state of the art in network
  analysis and security.
</p>

<h2>Slightly longer personal bio</h2>

<p>
  Given the bold new world of telecommuting, I live in Boston,
  Massachusetts, even though my company is based out of suburban
  Washington, DC.  I am a huge fan (and season ticket holder) of
  the <a href="http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/">Boston Red Sox</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I lived in sunny Oxford, England for three years while researching
  for my DPhil.  While there, I was a member
  of <a href="http://www.linacre.ox.ac.uk/">Linacre College</a>,
  played for Corpus-Linacre MCR football team, attended pub quiz
  weekly at the Cricketer's Arms, and ate far too many meals at Bodrum
  Kebab House.
</p>

<p>
  Working backwards, I was at MIT for seven years before heading off
  to Oxford: five of those getting my SB and MEng degrees, and two as
  a post-Masters researcher.  Even though I was (and am) a computer
  scientist, I did my research in the Department of Biology, as a
  member of the <a href="http://sorger.med.harvard.edu/">Sorger
  Lab</a>, which has since moved across the river to Harvard Medical.
  I was also a member of the <a href="http://zetapsi.mit.edu/">Rho
  Alpha chapter</a> of the <a href="http://www.zetapsi.org/">Zeta Psi
  Fraternity</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Before MIT, I spent my formative years living in Minnesota and North
  Carolina, though my family is originally from the mountains of East
  Tennessee.  This gives me a somewhat schizophrenic view of college
  sports, as I cheer for the Gophers in hockey, the Volunteers in
  football, and the Blue Devils in basketball.
</p>
