      <h1><a href="/2016/08/csp-concurrency-prelims/">Preliminaries</a></h1>
      <p>Before diving into the details of our first concurrency model, it will be
helpful to give an overview of how we&rsquo;re going to use CSP in these posts.</p>

<p>At the highest level, a CSP specification consists of a set of <em>processes</em>,
which use <em>events</em> to describe their behavior.  We use a process to represent
any vantage point that lets us talk about which events occur and in which order.
Each entity in our system is a process (which might be defined using
subprocesses to describe each of its components or parts).  We also use
processes to describe how two or more entities interact with each other, and to
describe any global properties of the entire system.  And lastly, because CSP
verification is based on &ldquo;refinement&rdquo;, we also use processes to define the
properties that we hope our system exhibits.</p>

      <h1><a href="/2016/07/csp-concurrency-intro/">Introduction</a></h1>
      <p>Two years ago, I started writing a series of <a href="/2014/01/07/intro-to-csp/">blog</a>
<a href="/2014/02/csp-basics/">posts</a> about CSP — Communicating Sequential Processes.
That series has&hellip;let&rsquo;s say &ldquo;stalled&rdquo;.  Part of the reason is that I didn&rsquo;t have
a good non-trivial example to work with.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes#Examples">stereotypical running
example</a>
is the vending machine: start with a simple one, which accepts a single coin and
spits out a tea; add more detail as you introduce more of the language.  I
always had a hunch that I needed an example with more meat on it, but could
never find one.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to today.  I was reading through some of
<a href="https://christophermeiklejohn.com/">Meiklejohn&rsquo;s</a> work on
<a href="http://lasp-lang.org/">LASP</a>, I came across a citation to a <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2015/5375/">really nice
paper</a>, which adds some
formal rigor to the consistency models that we use to describe modern
distributed systems.  Their formalism is a great combination of simple and
expressive.  The core of the paper is about processes accessing a transactional
data store, and when it&rsquo;s time to break out the proofs, one of their main tools
is &ldquo;observational refinement&rdquo;.  This naturally led me to think about describing
these same consistency models using CSP processes.</p>

<p>And so I finally found my meaty running example!  I&rsquo;m resurrecting this blog
series, and plan to work through each of the consistency models and proofs
descirbed in the paper, translating them into CSP processes and refinements.
This isn&rsquo;t an attempt to replace or outdo anything in the paper!  Far from it —
it&rsquo;s my attempt to use something more familiar to work through the details of
something less familiar.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to assume a working knowledge of CSP — or of the consistency
models described in the paper!  If you&rsquo;re familiar with one, my hope is that
you&rsquo;ll be able to follow along and pick up the other.  And if you&rsquo;re not
familiar with either&hellip;well, I guess we&rsquo;ll see how good I am at writing an intro
to a difficult topic!</p>

      <p>At <a href="http://www.redjack.com/">RedJack</a>, all of our <a href="http://www.redjack.com/solutions/">core
products</a> depend on a network sensor that
collects various bits of information about the raw traffic that we see on the
network.  We&rsquo;re doing some non-trivial analysis on fairly large network links
using commodity hardware, so we&rsquo;ve implemented this sensor in C.  At its core is
an extremely fast custom <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming">flow-based

It&rsquo;s a damn cool piece of code, but this post isn&rsquo;t about the code itself; it&rsquo;s
about how we deliver that code to our customers.</p>

<p>Just because we&rsquo;ve written this component in C, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we want to
turn our back on the kinds of tooling you get to use when working in other, more
modern languages.  In particular, once you&rsquo;ve gotten used to modern package
managers like <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">npm</a>, <a href="http://leiningen.org/">leiningen</a>,
<a href="http://golang.org/doc/articles/go_command.html">go</a>, and

      <h1><a href="/2014/05/git-flow/">Tagged releases using git flow</a></h1>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve used <code>git flow</code> for most of my software projects — specifically for those
that have versioned releases.  The <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">original
post</a> describing <code>git
flow</code> is still the best overview of how it works.  In short, you have a <code>master</code>
branch where <strong>every</strong> commit is a merge commit.  Each of these merge commits
represents a new release, and is tagged with the version number of that release.
The merge brings in all of the subsidiary commits and feature branches that make
up that release.  Ongoing work happens on a separate <code>develop</code> branch.  This is
where you merge in completed new features and bug fixes on a day-to-day basis.
<code>develop</code> should always be a stable version of the software — you don&rsquo;t merge a
feature branch into <code>develop</code> until it passes all of your tests and is
&ldquo;complete&rdquo; with regards to the feature you&rsquo;re trying to implement.</p>

<p>My favorite part of this model is how each release is just some tagged commit on
the <code>master</code> branch.  You want to see the code for the latest released version?
That&rsquo;s easy — <code>git checkout master</code>.  You want version 1.2.5 specifically?  Use
<code>git checkout 1.2.5</code> instead.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the <a href="https://github.com/nvie/gitflow"><code>git flow</code> tool</a> has
implemented a <a href="https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/issues/206">slightly different
behavior</a> for awhile now.  That
patch makes <code>git flow</code> tag the last commit on the release branch, instead of the
merge commit on the <code>master</code> branch.  The reasons for this might be perfectly
valid, but it&rsquo;s not what I want, and it&rsquo;s not what the original <code>git flow</code> post
described.  That means that I can&rsquo;t use <code>git flow release finish</code> as-is.</p>

      <p class="big-def">
  <span class="tldr">tl;dr</span> CSP is a <em>formal method</em> that lets you
  describe and reason about the behavior of <em>concurrent systems</em>.  CSP is
  <em>composable</em>; you write simple <em>processes</em>, and then use special
  <em>operators</em> to combine them together into larger, more complex
  processes.  A process is a summary of some system; it uses <em>events</em> to
  describe how that system works, and to <em>synchronously communicate</em> with
  other processes.  You can compare two processes using a <em>refinement
  check</em>; this lets us check, for instance, whether a real-world system
  satisfies some important safety or liveness property.  CSP has good <em>tool
  support</em>, which lets us perform these refinement checks quickly and
  automatically.
</p>

<p>Well that was easy, wasn&rsquo;t it?  You can boil just about anything down to a
single paragraph.  Let&rsquo;s look at each of those key points in more detail.</p>

      <h1><a href="/2014/01/07/intro-to-csp/">CSP: An introduction</a></h1>
      <p>Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) has been around for almost four decades
at this point, but for much of its life, it was only well-known among
theoretical computer scientists and formal methods advocates.  More recently,
many more people have at least <em>heard</em> of CSP, largely because it inspired the
<a href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#concurrency">concurrency support</a> in
<a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>, a popular mainstream programming language.  However,
if you ask most people what it <em>means</em> to be inspired by CSP, the most common
response would probably be &ldquo;erm, something about message passing&rdquo;?</p>

<p>That said, CSP isn&rsquo;t just some dusty theory that inspired part of Go; it can
also help us understand the distributed systems that we create.  We&rsquo;ve developed
a <a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/">plethora</a> <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">of</a>
<a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">tools</a> <a href="http://redis.io/">that</a>
<a href="http://basho.com/riak/">help</a> <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">us</a>
<a href="http://hbase.apache.org/">build</a> <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">distributed</a>
<a href="http://storm-project.net/">systems</a>.  But unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t always
understand of how those tools work, how they fail, and how they interact when we
piece them together into a larger system.  We can all name-drop the <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=564601">CAP
theorem</a>, but do you <em>really</em> know
what your system is going to do when the network partitions, or when a host
dies?  How do you convince someone that you&rsquo;re right?</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t just rely on intuition and hand-wavy arguments; our systems are too
large, and too important, for that.  So how do you address these concerns with
rigor?  There are two main approaches: you can either <em>test</em> your assumptions
empirically on a running system, or you can describe your system in detail and
<em>prove</em> that your assumptions are correct.  Kyle Kingsbury has great examples of
both: <a href="http://aphyr.com/tags/jepsen">Jepsen</a> on the testing side,
<a href="http://aphyr.com/posts/309-knossos-redis-and-linearizability">Knossos</a> on the
proof side.  Both approaches are important; if you want to be convincing, you
have to choose at least one of them.  If you prefer the proof-based approach,
CSP is another option.  If you only think of CSP in terms of Go&rsquo;s concurrency
primitives, or if you haven&rsquo;t thought of it at all, then you overlook the fact
that CSP was <em>specifically designed</em> to help answer these kinds of questions.</p>

<p>In this series of articles, I want to describe how CSP fits into this landscape,
for developers with a range of expertise.  For the every-day programmer, I want
to give a basic, high-level introduction to CSP, and to explain what it means
for Go to be inspired by CSP.  For the distributed systems engineer, I want to
add weight to the argument that formal methods are a useful tool for studying
and designing the systems that we create and use.  And for the formal methodist,
I want to show how to use CSP in particular to specify and reason about those
systems.</p>

      <p>Part of the software I help develop at
<a href="http://www.redjack.com/">RedJack</a> needs to be tested on both
little-endian and big-endian machines.  Little-endian machines are
easy, since everyone and their mother is running on a little-endian
Intel or AMD x86 chip.  It used to be that big-endian was pretty easy
to test, too — just break out your trusty Apple Powerbook G4 and
you&rsquo;re good to go.  Since Apple has shifted over to Intel chips,
though, the situation has changed.</p>

<p>Luckily, <a href="http://wiki.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> has PowerPC as one of the
targets that it can emulate, so in theory, I can still easily test my
code on a big-endian machine by creating a QEMU PowerPC virtual
machine.  There&rsquo;s already a writeup about trying to install Debian
onto a QEMU VM
<a href="http://machine-cycle.blogspot.com/2009/05/running-debian-on-qemu-powerpc.html">here</a>.
<a href="http://www.aurel32.net/">Aurélien Jarno</a> has graciously put together
downloadable disk images with Debian preinstalled.  If that&rsquo;s good
enough for your purposes, just go download those!  You won&rsquo;t need any
of the rest of the information on this page.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t want to run stock Debian; my little-endian
build machine is running Ubuntu Lucid, and for consistency, I wanted
my big-endian VM to be running the same.  As it turns out, this also
required a fair dose of masochism on my part.  There are several
issues that you&rsquo;ll encounter if you try to do this by hand.  Here is
my cheat sheet for getting around these issues.</p>

<p>Note that this isn&rsquo;t a full step-by-step account of how to install
Lucid onto a QEMU VM.  For now, I&rsquo;m just trying to get my notes down
into a more permanent form.</p>

      <p>This post is the first in a series that describes the
<code>push_callback_t</code> type in the
<a href="http://github.com/dcreager/libpush/">libpush</a> library.  In these
posts, we&rsquo;ll walk through a couple of possible ways to implement
callbacks under the covers.  At each stage, we&rsquo;ll encounter problems
with the current design.  Fixing these problems should lead closer us
to the actual implementation in libpush, and along the way, we&rsquo;ll gain
a good understanding of how our design decisions affect the
performance and usability of the library.</p>

<p>The <code>push_callback_t</code> type is used to define <em>parser callbacks</em>, which
are the basic unit of parsing in libpush.  Callbacks are pretty
simple: they take in an <em>input value</em>, read some data from the <em>input
stream</em>, and produce an <em>output value</em>.  (The fact that callbacks take
in an input value, in addition to reading from the input stream, is
what makes them <a href="http://www.haskell.org/arrows/"><em>arrows</em></a> instead of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29"><em>monads</em></a>
— but that&rsquo;s a story for a later post).</p>

      <h1><a href="/2010/02/17/llvm-lto-karmic/">Using LLVM's link-time optimization on Ubuntu Karmic</a></h1>
      <p>While playing around with
<a href="http://github.com/dcreager/libpush">libpush</a> on my MacBook, I was
pleasantly surprised to see a huge performance increase when I used
the link-time optimization (LTO) feature of the LLVM GCC front end.
(It&rsquo;s really quite nifty; the new <a href="http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">Homebrew package
manager</a> uses it by default when
compiling packages.)  On MacOS, using LTO is as simple as using
<code>llvm-gcc</code> as your C compiler (or <code>llvm-g++</code> if you&rsquo;re compiling C++),
and passing in <code>-O4</code> as your optimization flag.  I use SCons as my
builder, so this turns into:</p>

<pre><code>$ scons CC=llvm-gcc CCFLAGS=-O4
</code></pre>

<p>This will cause GCC to output LLVM bytecode into the <em>.o</em> output
files, and to perform whole-program optimizations during each linking
phase.  I was able to see a big performance win simply from the linker
being able to inline in copies of small functions that live in “other”
compilation units.</p>

      <h1><a href="/2010/02/10/setuptools-git-version-numbers/">Extracting setuptools version numbers from your git repository</a></h1>
      <p>Just like everyone else, we&rsquo;re using
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools</a> as the core of
the build system for our Python-based projects.  For the most part,
this has been a painless, straightforward process.  However, one
lingering annoyance is that we&rsquo;ve been specifying the version number
directly in our <em>setup.py</em> files:</p>

<pre class="CodeRay"><code><span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="include">setuptools</span> <span class="keyword">import</span> <span class="include">setup</span>

setup(
    name = <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&ldquo;</span><span class="content">awesomelib</span><span class="delimiter">&rdquo;</span></span>,
    version = <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&ldquo;</span><span class="content">1.2</span><span class="delimiter">&rdquo;</span></span>,
    <span class="comment"># &hellip;etc</span>
)
</code></pre>

<p>On our maintenance branches, we get a nice <em>awesomelib-1.2.tar.gz</em>
file when we run <code>python setup.py sdist</code>.  On our development branch,
we&rsquo;ve also got the following <em>setup.cfg</em> file:</p>

<pre class="CodeRay"><code>[egg_info]
tag_build = dev
tag_date = true
</code></pre>

<p>That gives us tarballs like <em>awesomelib-1.2dev-20100210.tar.gz</em> on our
development branch.  Because we&rsquo;re using the <code>dev</code> suffix, which
setuptools considers to be a &ldquo;prerelease&rdquo;, we have to remember to
increment the version number in development whenever we cut a new
release.  The end result is that we have a longish process for
creating releases.  If we want to create a new 1.3 release, we have to
do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a new maintenance branch for 1.3:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b maint-1.3 master
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Update the <em>setup.cfg</em> file to remove the <code>tag_build</code> and
<code>tag_date</code> entries.  Commit this with a &ldquo;Tagging version 1.3&rdquo;
commit message.</p></li>
<li><p>Back on the development branch, update <em>setup.py</em> to increment the
&ldquo;development version&rdquo; to 1.4.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Granted, this isn&rsquo;t horribly difficult, but we can do better.</p>
