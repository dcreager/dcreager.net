<p>Congratulations, you’ve written a software library!  You hope that lots of
people will find it useful, and will take it as a dependency when writing their
own software.  You know that at some point you’ll have to make changes to your
library, either to add features or to fix bugs.  Being a good maintainer, you
want to be as diligent as possible in telling your users what to expect as you
publish these changes.  Will they need to change their code in response to the
changes that you’ve made?  Have you retired features that they depend on?  Or
are the changes “safe”, presumably requiring no updates on their part?</p>

<p>The traditional approach is to encode all of this information into an
easy-to-digest <strong>version number</strong>.  Of course, nothing in this world is simple,
so there are a number of different systems for encoding compatibility
information into a version number.  And surprisingly, if you’re writing a shared
library for a compiled language like C or C++, there are (at least!) two
different versioning systems that you’ll need to learn.  In this post, we’re
going to look at these different systems, how they relate to each other, and how
to actually apply these version numbers to your library using a couple of common
build tools.</p>

      <h1><a href="/obligations/intro/">Introduction</a></h1>
      
<p>Programming languages have a lot of interesting ways to think about what you’re
allowed to do, and not allowed to do.  In a statically typed language, your
compiler will yell at you if you try to do something that’s not allowed, and a
lot of interesting PL research involves teaching your language and compiler to
disallow things in increasingly sophisticated ways.</p>

<p>This is not limited to statically typed languages.  In a dynamically typed
language, your interpreter is just as invested in disallowing certain behaviors.
It’s just that the enforcement happens while your program is running!</p>

<p>Someone with a theoretical background might quibble with my choice of the word
“disallow”.  They might prefer that I say that certain operations in your
programming language are “invalid”.  In the world of mathematics, it’s usually
not the case that some little gremlin is actively preventing these operations
from occurring; instead, it’s that the invalid operations don’t even exist as
possibilities!</p>

<p>But regardless what language you’re programming in, and regardless of whether
you think in terms of <strong>permissions</strong> or <strong>possibilities</strong>, the act of
programming is to consider all of these possible operations, and choose which
ones you want to use to accomplish your goal.  At any given time, there are many
possible operations, and you have the control to decide which ones to use!</p>

<p>In this series of posts I want to look at the flip side of this, and talk about
<strong>requirements</strong> or <strong>obligations</strong>.  What mechanisms do programming languages
have to <em>force</em> you to perform some operation, or to ensure that some operation
is performed even if you don’t actively choose to do it yourself?</p>

<p>At the end of this series, I hope to convince you that obligations are just as
important as possibilities, and that there are interesting complex behaviors
that are easier to think about and work with if we use programming languages
that can talk about obligations directly.</p>

<p>Since CSP is a formal method, it’s not surprising that Roscoe spends a large
part of his textbook talking about how to use rigorous mathematics to talk about
processes.  He actually goes one step (er, two?) further and defines <strong>three
different</strong> ways to do so:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>denotational semantics</strong> defines (mathematically, using sets and
sequences) what the <em>behavior</em> of a process is.  Each CSP operator comes
with a rule for how to calculate a process’s behavior recursively — that is,
in terms of the behavior of its operands.  (So for example, the “external
choice” rule tells you how to define the behavior of \(P \mathrel{\Box}
Q\) in terms of the behavior of \(P\) and \(Q\).)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>algebraic semantics</strong> tell you to not worry about what a process
“means” or what it “does”.  Instead, it provides a list of <em>rewrite rules</em>
that let you change what the definition of a process looks like without
changing its behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>operational semantics</strong> say that a process is nothing more than a
state machine, with nodes representing processes (and subprocesses) and
edges representing the events that allow you to transition between them.  We
can learn anything important about a process just by interpreting or
analyzing this state machine.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

      <h1><a href="/hst/refinement-overview/">Refinement overview</a></h1>
      
<p>Our goal is to learn about CSP refinement by implementing a refinement checker.
So a good first step is to make sure we’re all on the same page about what
refinement is, and then to step through the refinement algorithm that we mean to
implement.  (If nothing else, that will help make sure I don’t go off on too
many tangents while implementing it!)</p>

<p>I’ve mentioned refinement elsewhere on this blog a few times (for instance,
<a href="/csp-concurrency/read-atomic-internal/#refinement">here</a>).  The basic idea is
that in CSP, you use the same process language to describe the system you’re
designing or investigating, as well as the properties that you would like that
system to have.  (This is unlike most other formal methods, where you have
separate languages for the system and the properties.)  In CSP, the system’s
process is typically called \(Impl\) (for <strong>implementation</strong>), and the
property description process is typically called \(Spec\) (for
<strong>specification</strong>).</p>

<p>CSP then defines several <strong>semantic models</strong> that provide rigorous mathematical
definitions of what a process’s behavior is.  You perform a refinement check
within the context of a particular semantic model.  A successful refinement
check tells you that the property defined by \(Spec\) “holds” — specifically,
that all of the behaviors of \(Impl\) are also allowed behaviors of
\(Spec\).  A failed refinement check gives you a <strong>counterexample</strong> — that is,
a specific behavior of \(Impl\) that was disallowed by \(Spec\).</p>

<p>The three most common semantic models are <strong>traces</strong>, <strong>failures</strong>, and
<strong>failures-divergences</strong>.  We’ll go into more detail about the mathematics
behind these semantic models in later posts; for now, the 10,000-foot overview
is that:</p>

<p>It seems like this blog is basically turning into “all things CSP”!  As part of
that trend, I’ve started implementing a new CSP refinement checker called
<a href="https://github.com/hst/hst/">HST</a>.  Why do this when there’s a perfectly good refinement checker in
<a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/fdr/">FDR</a>?  Well, I want to learn more about how FDR’s refinement algorithm works.
The algorithm is documented in Bill Roscoe’s <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/bill.roscoe/publications/68b.pdf">textbook</a> (and a series of
follow-on papers), and working through those descriptions gives you a good bit
of insight into how refinenment really works.  But I often find it easier to
learn a complex topic by implementing it (or at least, by looking at the code of
an implementation).  Hence HST!  In this new series of blog posts, I’m going to
walk through the CSP refinement algorithm in more detail than is presented in
the academic literature, by implementing it (and describing that implementation)
along the way.</p>

<p>I should emphasize that this is <strong>not</strong> meant to be a replacement for FDR!  FDR
is a very good piece of software, and if you’re writing any CSP specs in anger,
you probably want FDR at your disposal.  HST is meant to be more of an
educational exercise.  If people find it more generally useful than that, that’s
great!  But it’s not what I’m aiming for.</p>

<p>(And as for the name, “HST” does <em>not</em> stand for “Harry S. Truman”, just like
“FDR” does <em>not</em> stand for “Franklin Delano Roosevelt”.)</p>

<p>We’ll start by looking at the weakest concurrency model covered in the paper,
Read Atomic.  In fact, to keep things really simple to start with, we’re only
going to look at <em>one</em> of Read Atomic’s two axioms: <strong>internal consistency</strong>.
(We’ll look at external consistency in the next post.)</p>

<!--
 Read Atomic...can be implemented without requiring any coordination among
 replicas...a replica can decide to commit a transaction without consulting
 other replicas.
-->

<p>A transaction is internally consistent if it “reads its own writes”.  This is
the simplest axiom covered in the paper, since it expresses a property that’s
strictly <em>local</em> to each transaction; we don’t have to consider the behavior of
any other transaction when defining what it means for a transaction to be
internally consistent.</p>

<p>Before diving into the details of our first concurrency model, it will be
helpful to give an overview of how we’re going to use CSP in these posts.</p>

<p>At the highest level, a CSP specification consists of a set of <em>processes</em>,
which use <em>events</em> to describe their behavior.  We use a process to represent
any vantage point that lets us talk about which events occur and in which order.
Each entity in our system is a process (which might be defined using
subprocesses to describe each of its components or parts).  We also use
processes to describe how two or more entities interact with each other, and to
describe any global properties of the entire system.  And lastly, because CSP
verification is based on “refinement”, we also use processes to define the
properties that we hope our system exhibits.</p>

      <h1><a href="/csp-concurrency/intro/">Introduction</a></h1>
      
<p>Two years ago, I started writing a series of <a href="/2014/01/07/intro-to-csp/">blog</a>
<a href="/2014/02/csp-basics/">posts</a> about CSP — Communicating Sequential Processes.
That series has…let’s say “stalled”.  Part of the reason is that I didn’t have
a good non-trivial example to work with.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes#Examples">stereotypical running
example</a>
is the vending machine: start with a simple one, which accepts a single coin and
spits out a tea; add more detail as you introduce more of the language.  I
always had a hunch that I needed an example with more meat on it, but could
never find one.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to today.  I was reading through some of <a href="https://christophermeiklejohn.com/">Christopher
Meiklejohn’s</a> work on
<a href="http://lasp-lang.org/">Lasp</a>, I came across a citation to a really nice paper
by <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2015/5375/">Cerone, Bernardi, and
Gotsman</a>, which adds some
formal rigor to the consistency models that we use to describe modern
distributed systems.  Their formalism is a great combination of simple and
expressive.  The core of the paper is about processes accessing a transactional
data store; the authors provide formal definitions of several concurrency
models, and of some reference implementations that supposedly provide those
concurrency models.  They then use a technique called “observational refinement”
to show that the reference implementations really do provide the concurrency
guarantees in question.</p>

<p>This approach lines up very well with how you perform refinement checks in CSP
to show that systems satisfy some specification.  And so I finally found my
meaty running example!  I’m resurrecting this blog series, and plan to work
through each of the consistency models and proofs described in the paper,
translating them into CSP processes and refinement checks.  This isn’t an
attempt to replace or outdo anything in the paper!  Far from it — it’s my
attempt to use something more familiar to work through the details of something
less familiar.</p>

<p>I’m not going to assume a working knowledge of CSP — or of the consistency
models described in the paper!  If you’re familiar with one, my hope is that
you’ll be able to follow along and pick up the other.  And if you’re not
familiar with either…well, I guess we’ll see how good I am at writing an intro
to a difficult topic!</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.redjack.com/">RedJack</a>, all of our <a href="http://www.redjack.com/solutions/">core
products</a> depend on a network sensor that
collects various bits of information about the raw traffic that we see on the
network.  We’re doing some non-trivial analysis on fairly large network links
using commodity hardware, so we’ve implemented this sensor in C.  At its core is
an extremely fast custom <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming">flow-based
programming</a> framework.
It’s a damn cool piece of code, but this post isn’t about the code itself; it’s
about how we deliver that code to our customers.</p>

<p>Just because we’ve written this component in C, that doesn’t mean we want to
turn our back on the kinds of tooling you get to use when working in other, more
modern languages.  In particular, once you’ve gotten used to modern package
managers like <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">npm</a>, <a href="http://leiningen.org/">leiningen</a>,
<a href="http://golang.org/doc/articles/go_command.html">go</a>, and
