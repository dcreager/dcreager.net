actually <em>write</em> in some other higher-level language, which will be translated
into S₀.  We’ll see in later posts how this process works.  For now, don’t be
put off by the amount of boilerplate that you see here — it’s not something that
you’ll have to author directly!</p>

      <h1><a href="/swanson/intro/">Introduction</a></h1>
      <p>My <a href="https://twitter.com/dcreager">Twitter bio</a> currently lists me as (among
other things) a “PL dilettante”.  Which of course means that I’ve been hacking
around on my own programming language for a number of years!  (Seriously, this
has been a thing for a <strong><em>long</em></strong> time.  The earliest <a href="https://github.com/swanson-lang/swanson-lang-old/commit/e8aac263d76a63c8667fca5eee079ce8af345c2d">Swanson-related
commit</a> I can find is from 2012.)  It’s gone through a number of
iterations over that time, but I’m pretty happy with where it’s at right now.
Not complete by any stretch of the imagination.  But I’ve chatted about it in
passing with several people at this point, and I figured I need to write down
the details somewhere.  My friend and colleague Rob can hold forth on these
kinds of topics in <a href="https://twitter.com/rob_rix/status/1320544724864872453">epic</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/rob_rix/status/1320488333127110659">Twitter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/rob_rix/status/1320467572161236994">threads</a>, but I need
something more longform.  So here we are!</p>

<p>In this series of posts I’m going to describe Swanson, the programming language
framework that I’ve been noodling on.  It has two main components, one of which
is much more fleshed out than the other.</p>

<p>The first (not as fleshed out) part is an actual programming language, which
doesn’t even really have a name yet!  It brings in some interesting notions
about programmable syntax and parsing in a way that (I think) makes it easy to
construct things like DSLs.</p>

<p>The second (more important) part is an execution model that can be used as an IR
of sorts for <strong><em>all</em></strong> languages.  That makes it similar in spirit to
WebAssembly, in that the goal is to be something that you would compile (or
translate or transpile or whatever) many other languages <strong><em>into</em></strong>, and not
something to be written directly.  The Great Unnamed Language, like any other
language, would be compiled into Swanson the execution framework.</p>

      <p class="big-def"><em class="tldr">tl;dr</em> We’ve typically considered it a deal-breaker to discover that
an algorithm we care about is <em>NP</em>-hard.  We’ll go to great lengths to simplify
the problem domain so that we can switch to a polynomial-time algorithm.  But if
we simplify too much, then we run the risk that our solution is no longer
useful.  Luckily, we might not have to!  <em>NP</em>-hard is a <strong><em>worst-case</em></strong> bound.
If we can convince ourselves that we won’t encounter pathological inputs, the
<em>NP</em>-hard algorithm might be just fine in practice.</p>

<p>A couple of recent tweets really resonated me.</p>

<p><a href="https://adityamukerjee.net/">Aditya</a> started an interesting conversation:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you&#39;d asked me a few weeks ago whether I preferred squash-merges or merge commits, I&#39;d have been somewhat ambivalent.<br /><br />After today, I&#39;m pretty sold on squash-merge as the better strategy. It&#39;s not without drawbacks, but on net, it&#39;s still so much better to work with.</p>&mdash; Aditya Mukerjee (@chimeracoder) <a href="https://twitter.com/chimeracoder/status/986376765567356928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 17, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>I’ve always really liked having a “clean” history in the git logs of my
projects.  They look nicer!  There’s a real joy to running <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log"><code>git log</code></a> (or
even better, <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log"><code>git log --graph --all</code></a>!) on a project that’s
maintained a beautiful log.  There are a number of tangible benefits, too, which
<a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">others</a> <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/appendix/best-practices">have</a> <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/TarinGamberini/commit-messages-goodpractices">described</a> well enough that I
don’t need to repeat them here.</p>

<p>More than that, though, for a long time I assumed that if you were using GitHub
pull requests, there was One True Way to produce a clean history, echoed by
<a href="https://sevein.com/">Jesús</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Best merges to me are the fast-forward merges that bring a number of meaninful, atomic, functional and self-contained commits! Not always possible...</p>&mdash; Jesús García Crespo (@sevein) <a href="https://twitter.com/sevein/status/986412919964368896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>But recently, just like Aditya, I’ve had a change of heart!  I realized that I
was thinking about pull requests, and what they represent in terms of the final
commit log I’m aiming for, in the wrong way.  In this post I’ll describe the
come-to-Aditya moment that made me appreciate squash-commits.  And along the way
I’ll have described two workflows that make it easy to keep a clean history: one
that doesn’t use GitHub at all (and mimics how we did git-driven development
before GitHub existed), and one that does.</p>

      <p>Let’s say you’ve got a web site or REST service.  You have clients that send
requests to your server, which performs some interesting processing and sends
responses back.  The clients might be people using a browser, or native code in
a mobile app making requests on behalf of the user, or something more exotic.
But the overall picture is the same:</p>

<p><img src="/nel/intro/service-flow.png" alt="request service flow" class="figure" /></p>

the middle is completely out of your control?</p>

      <h1><a href="/shared-library-versions/">Shared library versions</a></h1>
      <p>Congratulations, you’ve written a software library!  You hope that lots of
people will find it useful, and will take it as a dependency when writing their
own software.  You know that at some point you’ll have to make changes to your
library, either to add features or to fix bugs.  Being a good maintainer, you
want to be as diligent as possible in telling your users what to expect as you
publish these changes.  Will they need to change their code in response to the
changes that you’ve made?  Have you retired features that they depend on?  Or
are the changes “safe”, presumably requiring no updates on their part?</p>

<p>The traditional approach is to encode all of this information into an
easy-to-digest <strong>version number</strong>.  Of course, nothing in this world is simple,
so there are a number of different systems for encoding compatibility
information into a version number.  And surprisingly, if you’re writing a shared
library for a compiled language like C or C++, there are (at least!) two
different versioning systems that you’ll need to learn.  In this post, we’re
going to look at these different systems, how they relate to each other, and how
to actually apply these version numbers to your library using a couple of common
build tools.</p>

      <h1><a href="/obligations/intro/">Introduction</a></h1>
      <p>Programming languages have a lot of interesting ways to think about what you’re
allowed to do, and not allowed to do.  In a statically typed language, your
compiler will yell at you if you try to do something that’s not allowed, and a
lot of interesting PL research involves teaching your language and compiler to
disallow things in increasingly sophisticated ways.</p>

<p>This is not limited to statically typed languages.  In a dynamically typed
language, your interpreter is just as invested in disallowing certain behaviors.
It’s just that the enforcement happens while your program is running!</p>

<p>Someone with a theoretical background might quibble with my choice of the word
“disallow”.  They might prefer that I say that certain operations in your
programming language are “invalid”.  In the world of mathematics, it’s usually
not the case that some little gremlin is actively preventing these operations
from occurring; instead, it’s that the invalid operations don’t even exist as
possibilities!</p>

<p>But regardless what language you’re programming in, and regardless of whether
you think in terms of <strong>permissions</strong> or <strong>possibilities</strong>, the act of
programming is to consider all of these possible operations, and choose which
ones you want to use to accomplish your goal.  At any given time, there are many
possible operations, and you have the control to decide which ones to use!</p>

<p>In this series of posts I want to look at the flip side of this, and talk about
<strong>requirements</strong> or <strong>obligations</strong>.  What mechanisms do programming languages
have to <em>force</em> you to perform some operation, or to ensure that some operation
is performed even if you don’t actively choose to do it yourself?</p>

<p>At the end of this series, I hope to convince you that obligations are just as
important as possibilities, and that there are interesting complex behaviors
that are easier to think about and work with if we use programming languages
that can talk about obligations directly.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="/hst/semantic-methods/">previous post</a>, we’re going to rely on
the <em>labeled transition system</em> defined by CSP’s <em>operational semantics</em> to
represent processes in our refinement checker.  An LTS is just a directed graph,
with nodes representing processes and subprocesses, and edges representing
events.  In this post, we’ll look at LTSes in a bit more detail, and at how best
to represent them in code.</p>

<p>Since CSP is a formal method, it’s not surprising that Roscoe spends a large
part of his textbook talking about how to use rigorous mathematics to talk about
processes.  He actually goes one step (er, two?) further and defines <strong>three
different</strong> ways to do so:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>denotational semantics</strong> defines (mathematically, using sets and
sequences) what the <em>behavior</em> of a process is.  Each CSP operator comes
with a rule for how to calculate a process’s behavior recursively — that is,
in terms of the behavior of its operands.  (So for example, the “external
choice” rule tells you how to define the behavior of \(P \mathrel{\Box}
Q\) in terms of the behavior of \(P\) and \(Q\).)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>algebraic semantics</strong> tell you to not worry about what a process
“means” or what it “does”.  Instead, it provides a list of <em>rewrite rules</em>
that let you change what the definition of a process looks like without
changing its behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>operational semantics</strong> say that a process is nothing more than a
state machine, with nodes representing processes (and subprocesses) and
edges representing the events that allow you to transition between them.  We
can learn anything important about a process just by interpreting or
analyzing this state machine.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
