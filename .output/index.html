      <h1><a href="/2014/01/07/intro-to-csp/">CSP: An introduction</a></h1>
      <p>Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) has been around for almost four decades
at this point, but for much of its life, it was only well-known among
theoretical computer scientists and formal methods advocates.  More recently,
many more people have at least <em>heard</em> of CSP, largely because it inspired the
<a href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#concurrency">concurrency support</a> in
<a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>, a popular mainstream programming language.  However,
if you ask most people what it <em>means</em> to be inspired by CSP, the most common
response would probably be &ldquo;erm, something about message passing&rdquo;?</p>

<p>That said, CSP isn&rsquo;t just some dusty theory that inspired part of Go; it can
also help us understand the distributed systems that we create.  We&rsquo;ve developed
a <a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/">plethora</a> <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">of</a>
<a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">tools</a> <a href="http://redis.io/">that</a>
<a href="http://basho.com/riak/">help</a> <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">us</a>
<a href="http://hbase.apache.org/">build</a> <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">distributed</a>
<a href="http://storm-project.net/">systems</a>.  But unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t always
understand of how those tools work, how they fail, and how they interact when we
piece them together into a larger system.  We can all name-drop the <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=564601">CAP
theorem</a>, but do you <em>really</em> know
what your system is going to do when the network partitions, or when a host
dies?  How do you convince someone that you&rsquo;re right?</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t just rely on intuition and hand-wavy arguments; our systems are too
large, and too important, for that.  So how do you address these concerns with
rigor?  There are two main approaches: you can either <em>test</em> your assumptions
empirically on a running system, or you can describe your system in detail and
<em>prove</em> that your assumptions are correct.  Kyle Kingsbury has great examples of
both: <a href="http://aphyr.com/tags/jepsen">Jepsen</a> on the testing side,
<a href="http://aphyr.com/posts/309-knossos-redis-and-linearizability">Knossos</a> on the
proof side.  Both approaches are important; if you want to be convincing, you
have to choose at least one of them.  If you prefer the proof-based approach,
CSP is another option.  If you only think of CSP in terms of Go&rsquo;s concurrency
primitives, or if you haven&rsquo;t thought of it at all, then you overlook the fact
that CSP was <em>specifically designed</em> to help answer these kinds of questions.</p>

<p>In this series of articles, I want to describe how CSP fits into this landscape,
for developers with a range of expertise.  For the every-day programmer, I want
to give a basic, high-level introduction to CSP, and to explain what it means
for Go to be inspired by CSP.  For the distributed systems engineer, I want to
add weight to the argument that formal methods are a useful tool for studying
and designing the systems that we create and use.  And for the formal methodist,
I want to show how to use CSP in particular to specify and reason about those
systems.</p>

      <p>Part of the software I help develop at
<a href="http://www.redjack.com/">RedJack</a> needs to be tested on both
little-endian and big-endian machines.  Little-endian machines are
easy, since everyone and their mother is running on a little-endian
Intel or AMD x86 chip.  It used to be that big-endian was pretty easy
to test, too — just break out your trusty Apple Powerbook G4 and
you&rsquo;re good to go.  Since Apple has shifted over to Intel chips,
though, the situation has changed.</p>

<p>Luckily, <a href="http://wiki.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> has PowerPC as one of the
targets that it can emulate, so in theory, I can still easily test my
code on a big-endian machine by creating a QEMU PowerPC virtual
machine.  There&rsquo;s already a writeup about trying to install Debian
onto a QEMU VM
<a href="http://machine-cycle.blogspot.com/2009/05/running-debian-on-qemu-powerpc.html">here</a>.
<a href="http://www.aurel32.net/">Aurélien Jarno</a> has graciously put together
downloadable disk images with Debian preinstalled.  If that&rsquo;s good
enough for your purposes, just go download those!  You won&rsquo;t need any
of the rest of the information on this page.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t want to run stock Debian; my little-endian
build machine is running Ubuntu Lucid, and for consistency, I wanted
my big-endian VM to be running the same.  As it turns out, this also
required a fair dose of masochism on my part.  There are several
issues that you&rsquo;ll encounter if you try to do this by hand.  Here is
my cheat sheet for getting around these issues.</p>

<p>Note that this isn&rsquo;t a full step-by-step account of how to install
Lucid onto a QEMU VM.  For now, I&rsquo;m just trying to get my notes down
into a more permanent form.</p>

      <h1><a href="/2010/02/25/libpush-callbacks-part-1/">Parser callbacks in libpush, Part 1 — Streams</a></h1>
      <p>This post is the first in a series that describes the
<code>push_callback_t</code> type in the
<a href="http://github.com/dcreager/libpush/">libpush</a> library.  In these
posts, we&rsquo;ll walk through a couple of possible ways to implement
callbacks under the covers.  At each stage, we&rsquo;ll encounter problems
with the current design.  Fixing these problems should lead closer us
to the actual implementation in libpush, and along the way, we&rsquo;ll gain
a good understanding of how our design decisions affect the
performance and usability of the library.</p>

<p>The <code>push_callback_t</code> type is used to define <em>parser callbacks</em>, which
are the basic unit of parsing in libpush.  Callbacks are pretty
simple: they take in an <em>input value</em>, read some data from the <em>input
stream</em>, and produce an <em>output value</em>.  (The fact that callbacks take
in an input value, in addition to reading from the input stream, is
what makes them <a href="http://www.haskell.org/arrows/"><em>arrows</em></a> instead of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29"><em>monads</em></a>
— but that&rsquo;s a story for a later post).</p>

      <p>While playing around with
<a href="http://github.com/dcreager/libpush">libpush</a> on my MacBook, I was
pleasantly surprised to see a huge performance increase when I used
the link-time optimization (LTO) feature of the LLVM GCC front end.
(It&rsquo;s really quite nifty; the new <a href="http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">Homebrew package
manager</a> uses it by default when
compiling packages.)  On MacOS, using LTO is as simple as using
<code>llvm-gcc</code> as your C compiler (or <code>llvm-g++</code> if you&rsquo;re compiling C++),
and passing in <code>-O4</code> as your optimization flag.  I use SCons as my
builder, so this turns into:</p>

<pre><code>$ scons CC=llvm-gcc CCFLAGS=-O4
</code></pre>

<p>This will cause GCC to output LLVM bytecode into the <em>.o</em> output
files, and to perform whole-program optimizations during each linking
phase.  I was able to see a big performance win simply from the linker
being able to inline in copies of small functions that live in “other”
compilation units.</p>

      <h1><a href="/2010/02/10/setuptools-git-version-numbers/">Extracting setuptools version numbers from your git repository</a></h1>
      <p>Just like everyone else, we&rsquo;re using
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools</a> as the core of
the build system for our Python-based projects.  For the most part,
this has been a painless, straightforward process.  However, one
lingering annoyance is that we&rsquo;ve been specifying the version number
directly in our <em>setup.py</em> files:</p>

<pre class="CodeRay"><code><span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="include">setuptools</span> <span class="keyword">import</span> <span class="include">setup</span>

setup(
    name = <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&ldquo;</span><span class="content">awesomelib</span><span class="delimiter">&rdquo;</span></span>,
    version = <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&ldquo;</span><span class="content">1.2</span><span class="delimiter">&rdquo;</span></span>,
    <span class="comment"># &hellip;etc</span>
)
</code></pre>

<p>On our maintenance branches, we get a nice <em>awesomelib-1.2.tar.gz</em>
file when we run <code>python setup.py sdist</code>.  On our development branch,
we&rsquo;ve also got the following <em>setup.cfg</em> file:</p>

<pre class="CodeRay"><code>[egg_info]
tag_build = dev
tag_date = true
</code></pre>

<p>That gives us tarballs like <em>awesomelib-1.2dev-20100210.tar.gz</em> on our
development branch.  Because we&rsquo;re using the <code>dev</code> suffix, which
setuptools considers to be a &ldquo;prerelease&rdquo;, we have to remember to
increment the version number in development whenever we cut a new
release.  The end result is that we have a longish process for
creating releases.  If we want to create a new 1.3 release, we have to
do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a new maintenance branch for 1.3:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b maint-1.3 master
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Update the <em>setup.cfg</em> file to remove the <code>tag_build</code> and
<code>tag_date</code> entries.  Commit this with a &ldquo;Tagging version 1.3&rdquo;
commit message.</p></li>
<li><p>Back on the development branch, update <em>setup.py</em> to increment the
&ldquo;development version&rdquo; to 1.4.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Granted, this isn&rsquo;t horribly difficult, but we can do better.</p>

      <h1><a href="/2010/02/06/libpush/">A combinator-based parsing library for C</a></h1>
      <p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been working on
<a href="http://github.com/dcreager/libpush/">libpush</a>, which a new parsing
library for C.  It has two main features that I think will be
valuable: it&rsquo;s a <em>push parser</em>, which means that instead of parsing a
file, stream, or single memory buffer, you supply the data (or &ldquo;push&rdquo;
it) to the parser in chunks, as it becomes available.  I plan to
discuss this aspect of the parser in more detail in a later post.</p>

<p>The other main feature is that you design your parsers using
<em>combinators</em>.  Parser combinators are widely used in Haskell, with
<a href="http://legacy.cs.uu.nl/daan/parsec.html">Parsec</a> being the most
common example.  Combinator-based parsing libraries are especially
nice in Haskell, because Haskell&rsquo;s syntax makes them look very simple.
For instance, a parser that parses matching nested parentheses is:</p>

<pre class="CodeRay"><code>parens :: Parser ()
parens = (char &lsquo;(&rsquo; &gt;&gt; parens &gt;&gt; char &lsquo;)&rsquo; &gt;&gt; parens) &lt;|&gt; return ()
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the <code>&lt;|&gt;</code> operator represents <em>choice</em>: we try parsing the left
operand, and if it fails, then we try the right operand.  In our
example, the right operand is the base case, which matches the empty
string.  The left operand parses an opening parenthesis; then
recursively calls itself to match any parentheses that might be nested
in the current set; then parses the closing parenthesis; and then
finally tries to match a nested set that occurs after the current set.</p>

      <p>I recently upgraded to OmniGraffle 5, which caused my
<a href="http://github.com/dcreager/graffle-export/">graffle-export</a> script to
break:</p>

<pre><code>$ graffle.sh ~/git/cwa/figures/analyst.graffle foo.pdf

<p>(This was first reported to me by Nima Talebi as <a href="http://github.com/dcreager/graffle-export/issues/issue/1">a
ticket</a> on
graffle-export&rsquo;s Github page.)</p>

<p>Before we can understand what error we&rsquo;re seeing, a little explanation
is in order.  The core logic of the OmniGraffle exporter is an
AppleScript.  Unfortunately, AppleScripts are stored in a binary
format, so if you go to the Github page, you can&rsquo;t easily view the
contents of the file.  The important line of the script is:</p>

      <h1><a href="/2010/01/08/default-scons-clean-targets/">Default “scons -c” targets</a></h1>
      <p>As I mentioned in a <a href="/2009/12/18/make-distclean-in-scons/">previous
post</a>, the automatic “clean”
target provided by SCons (<code>scons -c</code>) is very useful for cleaning out
build files, without requiring much in the way of configuration.
Anything that SCons generates when you run <code>scons</code> will be
automatically cleaned when you run <code>scons -c</code>.</p>

<p>While useful, I&rsquo;d like more control over the behavior of <code>scons -c</code>.
Specifically, being a good TDD junkie, I have several test cases that
I can run using <code>scons test</code>:</p>

<pre class="CodeRay"><code>build_test = env.Program( &hellip; )
env.Alias(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&ldquo;</span><span class="content">build-tests</span><span class="delimiter">&rdquo;</span></span>, build_test)

run_test = env.Alias(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&ldquo;</span><span class="content">test</span><span class="delimiter">&rdquo;</span></span>, [build_test],
                     [<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&ldquo;</span><span class="content">@%s</span><span class="delimiter">&rdquo;</span></span> % build_test[<span class="integer">0</span>].abspath])
env.AlwaysBuild(run_test)
</code></pre>

<p>By setting it up this way, the test programs aren&rsquo;t built by default:
you have to explicitly run <code>scons build-tests</code> (if you want to build
the tests but not run them) or <code>scons test</code> (if you want to build and
run them).  Moreover, because of SCons&rsquo;s dependency tracking, I can
just use <code>scons test</code> as my usual build command during my
Edit-Test-Debug loop.  SCons will automatically rebuild any changed
source files before running the tests.</p>

<p>All of this is great.  So what&rsquo;s the problem?  As I mentioned above,
<code>scons -c</code> only cleans the build files that are created by <code>scons</code> —
and since I&rsquo;ve explicitly set things up so that tests aren&rsquo;t <em>built</em>
by default, they&rsquo;ll also not be <em>cleaned</em> by default.  This means that
to fully clean out my build targets, I have to run two commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ scons -c
$ scons -c build-tests
</code></pre>

<p>Not ideal!  I&rsquo;d prefer if <code>scons -c</code> cleaned everything, just like
<code>make clean</code> would in the Automake world.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/OmniGraffle/">OmniGraffle</a> is
my tool of choice for creating figures for my papers.  It&rsquo;s biggest
drawback is that it&rsquo;s only available for Mac OS, which can make it
cumbersome if I&rsquo;m working on one of my Linux machines and need to
create or modify a figure.  But it&rsquo;s ease-of-use and the quality of
the figures it creates are hard to beat.</p>

<p>Of course, creating the figure isn&rsquo;t enough — since I write my papers
in LaTeX, I have to export my figures into EPS or PDF (depending on
whether I&rsquo;m creating a PostScript or PDF version of the paper) before
I can use them in my documents.  It&rsquo;s easy enough to use the Export
dialog to do this (keyboard shortcut: ⌥⌘E), but ideally I&rsquo;d like the
ability to export figures from the command line.  Coupled with a good
Makefile, this would let me run a simple <code>make paper</code> command, and
automatically re-export any necessary figures before rebuilding the
paper itself.</p>

<p>Luckily, OmniGraffle has always had rather good support for being
controlled via AppleScript.  The commands can be somewhat
undocumented, requiring a bit of trial and error, but while entrenched
in our PhD studies at Oxford, my colleague David Faitelson and I were
able to whip together a script that suited our needs.  I&rsquo;ve recently
extracted the code from our Oxford SVN repository and uploaded it to
<a href="http://github.com/dcreager/graffle-export">Github</a>.</p>

<p>To install the script, just place the <em>graffle.sh</em> and <em>graffle.scpt</em>
files into some directory that&rsquo;s on your <code>$PATH</code>, such as
<em>/usr/local/bin</em> or <em>$HOME/bin</em>.  Then just run</p>
