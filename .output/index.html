      <h1><a href="/swanson/s1/">S₁ for bootstrapping</a></h1>
      <p>In the <a href="../s0/">previous post</a>, we described S₀, and showed how it would be
<strong><em>absolutely disgusting</em></strong> to have to program in it directly.  Which is why I
described it as Swanson’s “assembly language”.  In this post, we’ll look into
exactly <em>how</em> the language is complicated, and use that to describe a <em>slightly</em>
better language named S₁.</p>

      <h1><a href="/staff-engineering-manager/">Staff engineering manager</a></h1>
      <p>I’ve been promoted!  As of January 1st, I will now be a Staff Engineering Manager at GitHub.</p>

<p>This is a new title on our career ladder, which was only added in the last couple of months.  Prior to this, the next promotion on the manager track would have been to Director.  The “Director” title, however, usually implies that you are no longer a line manager, and are instead a manager of managers.  You’re in charge of a larger group, consisting of a number of distinct teams.  As the Director of the group, you achieve impact by how your teams can work on a number of things in parallel.</p>

<p>For my own career progression, that left me with a difficult decision.  I joined GitHub specifically to work with the Semantic Code team, applying interesting program analysis ideas from research to create useful developer productivity features.  I’m still very invested in the people on this team, and the problems we’re trying to solve.  But working with a single team doesn’t line up well with the “Director” title, at least as it’s defined on our career ladder.  So going for a promotion would have realistically required moving to another part of the company, working on technology and product features that I’m less interested in.</p>

<p>We added the Staff Engineering Manager title to the career ladder specifically to address this discrepancy.  It allows me to progress in my career while still being the line manager of a single team.  I still have to show higher impact now with this new title.  And like on the IC ladder, “staff” implies that your impact needs to be cross-team in some way.</p>

<p>But so far — having not yet spent even a single day with my new title — it seems like a great fit!</p>

      <p>In the <a href="../execution-model/">previous post</a>, we talked about Swanson’s execution
model, but didn’t really describe what Swanson code <em>looks like</em>.  In this post,
we’ll look at S₀ (pronounced “ess naught”), which is Swanson’s “assembly
language”.</p>

<div class="aside">
  <p>As we’ll see, S₀ hews pretty closely to the Swanson execution model, and isn’t
really a language that you’ll want to program in directly.  Typically, you’ll
actually <em>write</em> in some other higher-level language, which will be translated
into S₀.  We’ll see in later posts how this process works.  For now, don’t be
put off by the amount of boilerplate that you see here — it’s not something that
you’ll have to author directly!</p>

      <h1><a href="/swanson/intro/">Introduction</a></h1>
      <p>My <a href="https://twitter.com/dcreager">Twitter bio</a> currently lists me as (among
other things) a “PL dilettante”.  Which of course means that I’ve been hacking
around on my own programming language for a number of years!  (Seriously, this
has been a thing for a <strong><em>long</em></strong> time.  The earliest <a href="https://github.com/swanson-lang/swanson-lang-old/commit/e8aac263d76a63c8667fca5eee079ce8af345c2d">Swanson-related
commit</a> I can find is from 2012.)  It’s gone through a number of
iterations over that time, but I’m pretty happy with where it’s at right now.
Not complete by any stretch of the imagination.  But I’ve chatted about it in
passing with several people at this point, and I figured I need to write down
the details somewhere.  My friend and colleague Rob can hold forth on these
kinds of topics in <a href="https://twitter.com/rob_rix/status/1320544724864872453">epic</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/rob_rix/status/1320488333127110659">Twitter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/rob_rix/status/1320467572161236994">threads</a>, but I need
something more longform.  So here we are!</p>

<p>In this series of posts I’m going to describe Swanson, the programming language
framework that I’ve been noodling on.  It has two main components, one of which
is much more fleshed out than the other.</p>

<p>The first (not as fleshed out) part is an actual programming language, which
doesn’t even really have a name yet!  It brings in some interesting notions
about programmable syntax and parsing in a way that (I think) makes it easy to
construct things like DSLs.</p>

<p>The second (more important) part is an execution model that can be used as an IR
of sorts for <strong><em>all</em></strong> languages.  That makes it similar in spirit to
WebAssembly, in that the goal is to be something that you would compile (or
translate or transpile or whatever) many other languages <strong><em>into</em></strong>, and not
something to be written directly.  The Great Unnamed Language, like any other
language, would be compiled into Swanson the execution framework.</p>

      <p class="big-def"><em class="tldr">tl;dr</em> We’ve typically considered it a deal-breaker to discover that
an algorithm we care about is <em>NP</em>-hard.  We’ll go to great lengths to simplify
the problem domain so that we can switch to a polynomial-time algorithm.  But if
we simplify too much, then we run the risk that our solution is no longer
useful.  Luckily, we might not have to!  <em>NP</em>-hard is a <strong><em>worst-case</em></strong> bound.
If we can convince ourselves that we won’t encounter pathological inputs, the
<em>NP</em>-hard algorithm might be just fine in practice.</p>

<p>A couple of recent tweets really resonated me.</p>

<p><a href="https://adityamukerjee.net/">Aditya</a> started an interesting conversation:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you&#39;d asked me a few weeks ago whether I preferred squash-merges or merge commits, I&#39;d have been somewhat ambivalent.<br /><br />After today, I&#39;m pretty sold on squash-merge as the better strategy. It&#39;s not without drawbacks, but on net, it&#39;s still so much better to work with.</p>&mdash; Aditya Mukerjee (@chimeracoder) <a href="https://twitter.com/chimeracoder/status/986376765567356928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 17, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>I’ve always really liked having a “clean” history in the git logs of my
projects.  They look nicer!  There’s a real joy to running <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log"><code>git log</code></a> (or
even better, <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log"><code>git log --graph --all</code></a>!) on a project that’s
maintained a beautiful log.  There are a number of tangible benefits, too, which
<a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">others</a> <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/appendix/best-practices">have</a> <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/TarinGamberini/commit-messages-goodpractices">described</a> well enough that I
don’t need to repeat them here.</p>

<p>More than that, though, for a long time I assumed that if you were using GitHub
pull requests, there was One True Way to produce a clean history, echoed by
<a href="https://sevein.com/">Jesús</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Best merges to me are the fast-forward merges that bring a number of meaninful, atomic, functional and self-contained commits! Not always possible...</p>&mdash; Jesús García Crespo (@sevein) <a href="https://twitter.com/sevein/status/986412919964368896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>But recently, just like Aditya, I’ve had a change of heart!  I realized that I
was thinking about pull requests, and what they represent in terms of the final
commit log I’m aiming for, in the wrong way.  In this post I’ll describe the
come-to-Aditya moment that made me appreciate squash-commits.  And along the way
I’ll have described two workflows that make it easy to keep a clean history: one
that doesn’t use GitHub at all (and mimics how we did git-driven development
before GitHub existed), and one that does.</p>

      <p>Let’s say you’ve got a web site or REST service.  You have clients that send
requests to your server, which performs some interesting processing and sends
responses back.  The clients might be people using a browser, or native code in
a mobile app making requests on behalf of the user, or something more exotic.
But the overall picture is the same:</p>

<p><img src="/nel/intro/service-flow.png" alt="request service flow" class="figure" /></p>

<p>How do you monitor this service — especially when that annoying cloudy bit in
the middle is completely out of your control?</p>

      <h1><a href="/shared-library-versions/">Shared library versions</a></h1>
      <p>Congratulations, you’ve written a software library!  You hope that lots of
people will find it useful, and will take it as a dependency when writing their
own software.  You know that at some point you’ll have to make changes to your
library, either to add features or to fix bugs.  Being a good maintainer, you
want to be as diligent as possible in telling your users what to expect as you
publish these changes.  Will they need to change their code in response to the
changes that you’ve made?  Have you retired features that they depend on?  Or
are the changes “safe”, presumably requiring no updates on their part?</p>

<p>The traditional approach is to encode all of this information into an
easy-to-digest <strong>version number</strong>.  Of course, nothing in this world is simple,
so there are a number of different systems for encoding compatibility
information into a version number.  And surprisingly, if you’re writing a shared
library for a compiled language like C or C++, there are (at least!) two
different versioning systems that you’ll need to learn.  In this post, we’re
going to look at these different systems, how they relate to each other, and how
to actually apply these version numbers to your library using a couple of common
build tools.</p>
