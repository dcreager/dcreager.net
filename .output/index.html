<p>Since CSP is a formal method, it’s not surprising that Roscoe spends a large
part of his textbook talking about how to use rigorous mathematics to talk about
processes.  He actually goes one step (er, two?) further and defines <strong>three
different</strong> ways to do so:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>denotational semantics</strong> defines (mathematically, using sets and
sequences) what the <em>behavior</em> of a process is.  Each CSP operator comes
with a rule for how to calculate a process’s behavior recursively — that is,
in terms of the behavior of its operands.  (So for example, the “external
choice” rule tells you how to define the behavior of \(P \mathrel{\Box}
Q\) in terms of the behavior of \(P\) and \(Q\).)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>algebraic semantics</strong> tell you to not worry about what a process
“means” or what it “does”.  Instead, it provides a list of <em>rewrite rules</em>
that let you change what the definition of a process looks like without
changing its behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>operational semantics</strong> say that a process is nothing more than a
state machine, with nodes representing processes (and subprocesses) and
edges representing the events that allow you to transition between them.  We
can learn anything important about a process just by interpreting or
analyzing this state machine.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

      <h1><a href="/2016/11/refinement-overview/">Refinement overview</a></h1>
      <p>Our goal is to learn about CSP refinement by implementing a refinement checker.
So a good first step is to make sure we’re all on the same page about what
refinement is, and then to step through the refinement algorithm that we mean to
implement.  (If nothing else, that will help make sure I don’t go off on too
many tangents while implementing it!)</p>

<p>I’ve mentioned refinement elsewhere on this blog a few times (for instance,
<a href="/2016/09/csp-read-atomic-internal/#refinement">here</a>).  The basic idea is that
in CSP, you use the same process language to describe the system you’re
designing or investigating, as well as the properties that you would like that
system to have.  (This is unlike most other formal methods, where you have
separate languages for the system and the properties.)  In CSP, the system’s
process is typically called \(Impl\) (for <strong>implementation</strong>), and the
property description process is typically called \(Spec\) (for
<strong>specification</strong>).</p>

<p>CSP then defines several <strong>semantic models</strong> that provide rigorous mathematical
definitions of what a process’s behavior is.  You perform a refinement check
within the context of a particular semantic model.  A successful refinement
check tells you that the property defined by \(Spec\) “holds” — specifically,
that all of the behaviors of \(Impl\) are also allowed behaviors of
\(Spec\).  A failed refinement check gives you a <strong>counterexample</strong> — that is,
a specific behavior of \(Impl\) that was disallowed by \(Spec\).</p>

<p>The three most common semantic models are <strong>traces</strong>, <strong>failures</strong>, and
<strong>failures-divergences</strong>.  We’ll go into more detail about the mathematics
behind these semantic models in later posts; for now, the 10,000-foot overview
is that:</p>

      <h1><a href="/2016/11/hst-intro/">Introduction</a></h1>
      <p>It seems like this blog is basically turning into “all things CSP”!  As part of
that trend, I’ve started implementing a new CSP refinement checker called
<a href="https://github.com/hst/hst/">HST</a>.  Why do this when there’s a perfectly good refinement checker in
<a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/fdr/">FDR</a>?  Well, I want to learn more about how FDR’s refinement algorithm works.
The algorithm is documented in Bill Roscoe’s <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/bill.roscoe/publications/68b.pdf">textbook</a> (and a series of
follow-on papers), and working through those descriptions gives you a good bit
of insight into how refinenment really works.  But I often find it easier to
learn a complex topic by implementing it (or at least, by looking at the code of
an implementation).  Hence HST!  In this new series of blog posts, I’m going to
walk through the CSP refinement algorithm in more detail than is presented in
the academic literature, by implementing it (and describing that implementation)
along the way.</p>

<p>I should emphasize that this is <strong>not</strong> meant to be a replacement for FDR!  FDR
is a very good piece of software, and if you’re writing any CSP specs in anger,
you probably want FDR at your disposal.  HST is meant to be more of an
educational exercise.  If people find it more generally useful than that, that’s
great!  But it’s not what I’m aiming for.</p>

<p>(And as for the name, “HST” does <em>not</em> stand for “Harry S. Truman”, just like
“FDR” does <em>not</em> stand for “Franklin Delano Roosevelt”.)</p>

<p>We’ll start by looking at the weakest concurrency model covered in the paper,
Read Atomic.  In fact, to keep things really simple to start with, we’re only
going to look at <em>one</em> of Read Atomic’s two axioms: <strong>internal consistency</strong>.
(We’ll look at external consistency in the next post.)</p>

<!--
 Read Atomic...can be implemented without requiring any coordination among
 replicas...a replica can decide to commit a transaction without consulting
 other replicas.
-->

<p>A transaction is internally consistent if it “reads its own writes”.  This is
the simplest axiom covered in the paper, since it expresses a property that’s
strictly <em>local</em> to each transaction; we don’t have to consider the behavior of
any other transaction when defining what it means for a transaction to be
internally consistent.</p>

      <p>Before diving into the details of our first concurrency model, it will be
helpful to give an overview of how we’re going to use CSP in these posts.</p>

<p>At the highest level, a CSP specification consists of a set of <em>processes</em>,
which use <em>events</em> to describe their behavior.  We use a process to represent
any vantage point that lets us talk about which events occur and in which order.
Each entity in our system is a process (which might be defined using
subprocesses to describe each of its components or parts).  We also use
processes to describe how two or more entities interact with each other, and to
describe any global properties of the entire system.  And lastly, because CSP
verification is based on “refinement”, we also use processes to define the
properties that we hope our system exhibits.</p>

      <h1><a href="/2016/07/csp-concurrency-intro/">Introduction</a></h1>
      <p>Two years ago, I started writing a series of <a href="/2014/01/07/intro-to-csp/">blog</a>
<a href="/2014/02/csp-basics/">posts</a> about CSP — Communicating Sequential Processes.
That series has…let’s say “stalled”.  Part of the reason is that I didn’t have
a good non-trivial example to work with.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes#Examples">stereotypical running
example</a>
is the vending machine: start with a simple one, which accepts a single coin and
spits out a tea; add more detail as you introduce more of the language.  I
always had a hunch that I needed an example with more meat on it, but could
never find one.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to today.  I was reading through some of <a href="https://christophermeiklejohn.com/">Christopher
Meiklejohn’s</a> work on
<a href="http://lasp-lang.org/">Lasp</a>, I came across a citation to a really nice paper
by <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2015/5375/">Cerone, Bernardi, and
Gotsman</a>, which adds some
formal rigor to the consistency models that we use to describe modern
distributed systems.  Their formalism is a great combination of simple and
expressive.  The core of the paper is about processes accessing a transactional
data store; the authors provide formal definitions of several concurrency
models, and of some reference implementations that supposedly provide those
concurrency models.  They then use a technique called “observational refinement”
to show that the reference implementations really do provide the concurrency
guarantees in question.</p>

<p>This approach lines up very well with how you perform refinement checks in CSP
to show that systems satisfy some specification.  And so I finally found my
meaty running example!  I’m resurrecting this blog series, and plan to work
through each of the consistency models and proofs described in the paper,
translating them into CSP processes and refinement checks.  This isn’t an
attempt to replace or outdo anything in the paper!  Far from it — it’s my
attempt to use something more familiar to work through the details of something
less familiar.</p>

<p>I’m not going to assume a working knowledge of CSP — or of the consistency
models described in the paper!  If you’re familiar with one, my hope is that
you’ll be able to follow along and pick up the other.  And if you’re not
familiar with either…well, I guess we’ll see how good I am at writing an intro
to a difficult topic!</p>

collects various bits of information about the raw traffic that we see on the

using commodity hardware, so we’ve implemented this sensor in C.  At its core is
an extremely fast custom <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming">flow-based

It’s a damn cool piece of code, but this post isn’t about the code itself; it’s

<p>Just because we’ve written this component in C, that doesn’t mean we want to
turn our back on the kinds of tooling you get to use when working in other, more

      <h1><a href="/2014/05/git-flow/">Tagged releases using git flow</a></h1>
      <p>I’ve used <code>git flow</code> for most of my software projects — specifically for those
that have versioned releases.  The <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">original
post</a> describing <code>git
flow</code> is still the best overview of how it works.  In short, you have a <code>master</code>
branch where <strong>every</strong> commit is a merge commit.  Each of these merge commits
represents a new release, and is tagged with the version number of that release.
The merge brings in all of the subsidiary commits and feature branches that make
up that release.  Ongoing work happens on a separate <code>develop</code> branch.  This is
where you merge in completed new features and bug fixes on a day-to-day basis.
<code>develop</code> should always be a stable version of the software — you don’t merge a
feature branch into <code>develop</code> until it passes all of your tests and is
“complete” with regards to the feature you’re trying to implement.</p>

<p>My favorite part of this model is how each release is just some tagged commit on
the <code>master</code> branch.  You want to see the code for the latest released version?
That’s easy — <code>git checkout master</code>.  You want version 1.2.5 specifically?  Use
<code>git checkout 1.2.5</code> instead.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the <a href="https://github.com/nvie/gitflow"><code>git flow</code> tool</a> has
implemented a <a href="https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/issues/206">slightly different
behavior</a> for awhile now.  That
patch makes <code>git flow</code> tag the last commit on the release branch, instead of the
merge commit on the <code>master</code> branch.  The reasons for this might be perfectly
valid, but it’s not what I want, and it’s not what the original <code>git flow</code> post
described.  That means that I can’t use <code>git flow release finish</code> as-is.</p>

      <p class="big-def"><em class="tldr">tl;dr</em> CSP is a <em>formal method</em> that lets you describe and reason
about the behavior of <em>concurrent systems</em>.  CSP is <em>composable</em>; you write
simple <em>processes</em>, and then use special <em>operators</em> to combine them together
into larger, more complex processes.  A process is a summary of some system; it
uses <em>events</em> to describe how that system works, and to <em>synchronously
communicate</em> with other processes.  You can compare two processes using a
<em>refinement check</em>; this lets us check, for instance, whether a real-world
system satisfies some important safety or liveness property.  CSP has good <em>tool
support</em>, which lets us perform these refinement checks quickly and
automatically.</p>

<p>Well that was easy, wasn’t it?  You can boil just about anything down to a
single paragraph.  Let’s look at each of those key points in more detail.</p>

      <h1><a href="/2014/01/07/intro-to-csp/">CSP: An introduction</a></h1>
      <p>Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) has been around for almost four decades
at this point, but for much of its life, it was only well-known among
theoretical computer scientists and formal methods advocates.  More recently,
many more people have at least <em>heard</em> of CSP, largely because it inspired the
<a href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#concurrency">concurrency support</a> in
<a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>, a popular mainstream programming language.  However,
if you ask most people what it <em>means</em> to be inspired by CSP, the most common
response would probably be “erm, something about message passing”?</p>

<p>That said, CSP isn’t just some dusty theory that inspired part of Go; it can
also help us understand the distributed systems that we create.  We’ve developed
a <a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/">plethora</a> <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">of</a>
<a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">tools</a> <a href="http://redis.io/">that</a>
<a href="http://basho.com/riak/">help</a> <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">us</a>
<a href="http://hbase.apache.org/">build</a> <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">distributed</a>
<a href="http://storm-project.net/">systems</a>.  But unfortunately, we don’t always
understand of how those tools work, how they fail, and how they interact when we
piece them together into a larger system.  We can all name-drop the <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=564601">CAP
theorem</a>, but do you <em>really</em> know
what your system is going to do when the network partitions, or when a host
dies?  How do you convince someone that you’re right?</p>

<p>We can’t just rely on intuition and hand-wavy arguments; our systems are too
large, and too important, for that.  So how do you address these concerns with
rigor?  There are two main approaches: you can either <em>test</em> your assumptions
empirically on a running system, or you can describe your system in detail and
<em>prove</em> that your assumptions are correct.  Kyle Kingsbury has great examples of
both: <a href="http://aphyr.com/tags/jepsen">Jepsen</a> on the testing side,
<a href="http://aphyr.com/posts/309-knossos-redis-and-linearizability">Knossos</a> on the
proof side.  Both approaches are important; if you want to be convincing, you
have to choose at least one of them.  If you prefer the proof-based approach,
CSP is another option.  If you only think of CSP in terms of Go’s concurrency
primitives, or if you haven’t thought of it at all, then you overlook the fact
that CSP was <em>specifically designed</em> to help answer these kinds of questions.</p>

<p>In this series of articles, I want to describe how CSP fits into this landscape,
for developers with a range of expertise.  For the every-day programmer, I want
to give a basic, high-level introduction to CSP, and to explain what it means
for Go to be inspired by CSP.  For the distributed systems engineer, I want to
add weight to the argument that formal methods are a useful tool for studying
and designing the systems that we create and use.  And for the formal methodist,
I want to show how to use CSP in particular to specify and reason about those
systems.</p>
