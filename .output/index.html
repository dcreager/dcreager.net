<p>A couple of recent tweets really resonated me.</p>

<p><a href="https://adityamukerjee.net/">Aditya</a> started an interesting conversation:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you&#39;d asked me a few weeks ago whether I preferred squash-merges or merge commits, I&#39;d have been somewhat ambivalent.<br /><br />After today, I&#39;m pretty sold on squash-merge as the better strategy. It&#39;s not without drawbacks, but on net, it&#39;s still so much better to work with.</p>&mdash; Aditya Mukerjee (@chimeracoder) <a href="https://twitter.com/chimeracoder/status/986376765567356928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 17, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>I’ve always really liked having a “clean” history in the git logs of my
projects.  They look nicer!  There’s a real joy to running <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log"><code>git log</code></a> (or
even better, <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log"><code>git log --graph --all</code></a>!) on a project that’s
maintained a beautiful log.  There are a number of tangible benefits, too, which
<a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">others</a> <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/appendix/best-practices">have</a> <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/TarinGamberini/commit-messages-goodpractices">described</a> well enough that I
don’t need to repeat them here.</p>

<p>More than that, though, for a long time I assumed that if you were using GitHub
pull requests, there was One True Way to produce a clean history, echoed by
<a href="https://sevein.com/">Jesús</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Best merges to me are the fast-forward merges that bring a number of meaninful, atomic, functional and self-contained commits! Not always possible...</p>&mdash; Jesús García Crespo (@sevein) <a href="https://twitter.com/sevein/status/986412919964368896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>But recently, just like Aditya, I’ve had a change of heart!  I realized that I
was thinking about pull requests, and what they represent in terms of the final
commit log I’m aiming for, in the wrong way.  In this post I’ll describe the
come-to-Aditya moment that made me appreciate squash-commits.  And along the way
I’ll have described two workflows that make it easy to keep a clean history: one
that doesn’t use GitHub at all (and mimics how we did git-driven development
before GitHub existed), and one that does.</p>

<p>Let’s say you’ve got a web site or REST service.  You have clients that send
requests to your server, which performs some interesting processing and sends
responses back.  The clients might be people using a browser, or native code in
a mobile app making requests on behalf of the user, or something more exotic.
But the overall picture is the same:</p>

<p>Congratulations, you’ve written a software library!  You hope that lots of
people will find it useful, and will take it as a dependency when writing their
own software.  You know that at some point you’ll have to make changes to your
library, either to add features or to fix bugs.  Being a good maintainer, you
want to be as diligent as possible in telling your users what to expect as you
publish these changes.  Will they need to change their code in response to the
changes that you’ve made?  Have you retired features that they depend on?  Or
are the changes “safe”, presumably requiring no updates on their part?</p>

<p>The traditional approach is to encode all of this information into an
easy-to-digest <strong>version number</strong>.  Of course, nothing in this world is simple,
so there are a number of different systems for encoding compatibility
information into a version number.  And surprisingly, if you’re writing a shared
library for a compiled language like C or C++, there are (at least!) two
different versioning systems that you’ll need to learn.  In this post, we’re
going to look at these different systems, how they relate to each other, and how
to actually apply these version numbers to your library using a couple of common
build tools.</p>

<p>Programming languages have a lot of interesting ways to think about what you’re
allowed to do, and not allowed to do.  In a statically typed language, your
compiler will yell at you if you try to do something that’s not allowed, and a
lot of interesting PL research involves teaching your language and compiler to
disallow things in increasingly sophisticated ways.</p>

<p>This is not limited to statically typed languages.  In a dynamically typed
language, your interpreter is just as invested in disallowing certain behaviors.
It’s just that the enforcement happens while your program is running!</p>

<p>Someone with a theoretical background might quibble with my choice of the word
“disallow”.  They might prefer that I say that certain operations in your
programming language are “invalid”.  In the world of mathematics, it’s usually
not the case that some little gremlin is actively preventing these operations
from occurring; instead, it’s that the invalid operations don’t even exist as
possibilities!</p>

<p>But regardless what language you’re programming in, and regardless of whether
you think in terms of <strong>permissions</strong> or <strong>possibilities</strong>, the act of
programming is to consider all of these possible operations, and choose which
ones you want to use to accomplish your goal.  At any given time, there are many
possible operations, and you have the control to decide which ones to use!</p>

<p>In this series of posts I want to look at the flip side of this, and talk about
<strong>requirements</strong> or <strong>obligations</strong>.  What mechanisms do programming languages
have to <em>force</em> you to perform some operation, or to ensure that some operation
is performed even if you don’t actively choose to do it yourself?</p>

<p>At the end of this series, I hope to convince you that obligations are just as
important as possibilities, and that there are interesting complex behaviors
that are easier to think about and work with if we use programming languages
that can talk about obligations directly.</p>

<p>Since CSP is a formal method, it’s not surprising that Roscoe spends a large
part of his textbook talking about how to use rigorous mathematics to talk about
processes.  He actually goes one step (er, two?) further and defines <strong>three
different</strong> ways to do so:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>denotational semantics</strong> defines (mathematically, using sets and
sequences) what the <em>behavior</em> of a process is.  Each CSP operator comes
with a rule for how to calculate a process’s behavior recursively — that is,
in terms of the behavior of its operands.  (So for example, the “external
choice” rule tells you how to define the behavior of \(P \mathrel{\Box}
Q\) in terms of the behavior of \(P\) and \(Q\).)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>algebraic semantics</strong> tell you to not worry about what a process
“means” or what it “does”.  Instead, it provides a list of <em>rewrite rules</em>
that let you change what the definition of a process looks like without
changing its behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>operational semantics</strong> say that a process is nothing more than a
state machine, with nodes representing processes (and subprocesses) and
edges representing the events that allow you to transition between them.  We
can learn anything important about a process just by interpreting or
analyzing this state machine.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

      <h1><a href="/hst/refinement-overview/">Refinement overview</a></h1>
      
<p>Our goal is to learn about CSP refinement by implementing a refinement checker.
So a good first step is to make sure we’re all on the same page about what
refinement is, and then to step through the refinement algorithm that we mean to
implement.  (If nothing else, that will help make sure I don’t go off on too
many tangents while implementing it!)</p>

<p>I’ve mentioned refinement elsewhere on this blog a few times (for instance,
<a href="/csp-concurrency/read-atomic-internal/#refinement">here</a>).  The basic idea is
that in CSP, you use the same process language to describe the system you’re
designing or investigating, as well as the properties that you would like that
system to have.  (This is unlike most other formal methods, where you have
separate languages for the system and the properties.)  In CSP, the system’s
process is typically called \(Impl\) (for <strong>implementation</strong>), and the
property description process is typically called \(Spec\) (for
<strong>specification</strong>).</p>

<p>CSP then defines several <strong>semantic models</strong> that provide rigorous mathematical
definitions of what a process’s behavior is.  You perform a refinement check
within the context of a particular semantic model.  A successful refinement
check tells you that the property defined by \(Spec\) “holds” — specifically,
that all of the behaviors of \(Impl\) are also allowed behaviors of
\(Spec\).  A failed refinement check gives you a <strong>counterexample</strong> — that is,
a specific behavior of \(Impl\) that was disallowed by \(Spec\).</p>

<p>The three most common semantic models are <strong>traces</strong>, <strong>failures</strong>, and
<strong>failures-divergences</strong>.  We’ll go into more detail about the mathematics
behind these semantic models in later posts; for now, the 10,000-foot overview
is that:</p>

<p>It seems like this blog is basically turning into “all things CSP”!  As part of
that trend, I’ve started implementing a new CSP refinement checker called
<a href="https://github.com/hst/hst/">HST</a>.  Why do this when there’s a perfectly good refinement checker in
<a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/fdr/">FDR</a>?  Well, I want to learn more about how FDR’s refinement algorithm works.
The algorithm is documented in Bill Roscoe’s <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/bill.roscoe/publications/68b.pdf">textbook</a> (and a series of
follow-on papers), and working through those descriptions gives you a good bit
of insight into how refinenment really works.  But I often find it easier to
learn a complex topic by implementing it (or at least, by looking at the code of
an implementation).  Hence HST!  In this new series of blog posts, I’m going to
walk through the CSP refinement algorithm in more detail than is presented in
the academic literature, by implementing it (and describing that implementation)
along the way.</p>

<p>I should emphasize that this is <strong>not</strong> meant to be a replacement for FDR!  FDR
is a very good piece of software, and if you’re writing any CSP specs in anger,
you probably want FDR at your disposal.  HST is meant to be more of an
educational exercise.  If people find it more generally useful than that, that’s
great!  But it’s not what I’m aiming for.</p>

<p>(And as for the name, “HST” does <em>not</em> stand for “Harry S. Truman”, just like
“FDR” does <em>not</em> stand for “Franklin Delano Roosevelt”.)</p>

<p>We’ll start by looking at the weakest concurrency model covered in the paper,
Read Atomic.  In fact, to keep things really simple to start with, we’re only
going to look at <em>one</em> of Read Atomic’s two axioms: <strong>internal consistency</strong>.
(We’ll look at external consistency in the next post.)</p>

<!--
 Read Atomic...can be implemented without requiring any coordination among
 replicas...a replica can decide to commit a transaction without consulting
 other replicas.
-->

<p>A transaction is internally consistent if it “reads its own writes”.  This is
the simplest axiom covered in the paper, since it expresses a property that’s
strictly <em>local</em> to each transaction; we don’t have to consider the behavior of
any other transaction when defining what it means for a transaction to be
internally consistent.</p>

<p>Before diving into the details of our first concurrency model, it will be
helpful to give an overview of how we’re going to use CSP in these posts.</p>

<p>At the highest level, a CSP specification consists of a set of <em>processes</em>,
which use <em>events</em> to describe their behavior.  We use a process to represent
any vantage point that lets us talk about which events occur and in which order.
Each entity in our system is a process (which might be defined using
subprocesses to describe each of its components or parts).  We also use
processes to describe how two or more entities interact with each other, and to
describe any global properties of the entire system.  And lastly, because CSP
verification is based on “refinement”, we also use processes to define the
properties that we hope our system exhibits.</p>
