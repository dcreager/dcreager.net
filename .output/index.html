      <h1><a href="/sony-rx100-mkiv-webcam/">Using a Sony RX100 Mk IV as a webcam on Linux</a></h1>
      <p>Earlier this month I decided to use some of my company‚Äôs generous home office
reimbursement to test out the ‚Äúuse a real digital camera as a webcam‚Äù craze
that‚Äôs been going around.  I spend most of my day on Zoom meetings with
colleagues and other people around the industry, so I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be the
<em>worst</em> use of money ‚Äî especially if it noticeably increased the quality of the
video feed that I‚Äôm sending out into the world.</p>

<p>To raise the level of difficulty, my primary machine is a beefy Linux
workstation.  And as we all know, Linux is well-known for being straightforward
and easy to configure‚Ä¶ üôÑ</p>

<p>In the end, I decided to return the camera and stick with my battle-tested,
traditional Logitech C920 webcam.  But in case others are interested in getting
this setup working under Linux, here are my notes!</p>

      <h1><a href="/git/commits-and-code-review/">Git commits and code review (revisited)</a></h1>
      <p>Drew DeVault had an interesting post yesterday (<a href="gemini://drewdevault.com/2021/01/02/2021-01-02-Every-commit-should-be-perfect.gmi">gemini</a>, <a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/drewdevault.com/2021/01/02/2021-01-02-Every-commit-should-be-perfect.gmi">web</a>) about how large a git commit should be.  It echoes several points that I tried to make a couple of years back in a <a href="https://dcreager.net/git/workflows/">post of my own</a>.</p>

<p>I agree with all of the points Drew makes, and try to follow the best practices that he outlines in my own projects.  There‚Äôs an alternative mindset, though, which is very popular these days ‚Äî and I‚Äôve argued at length with my collegues at GitHub about the merits and drawbacks of each approach.  The different mindsets grow out of a point that Drew mentioned:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you receive feedback on your patch and make updates, continue to rebase and improve your original commit, or commits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and that I called out as its own top-level rule for what makes a ‚Äúclean‚Äù git history:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code review does not appear in the final history of your project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôve seen this alternative mindset most often with projects that have fully bought in to using GitHub as their project hub, but it is <em>not</em> limited to GitHub!  I‚Äôve also seen it with projects hosted on GitLab, Gitea, Phabricator, and Gerrit.  All of those code forges are centered around the Pull Request (or Merge Request or whatever else you might call it) as the mechanism for code review.  There <em>are</em> differences in workflow between these hosts ‚Äî Phabricator and Gerrit, for instance, have much better support for ‚Äústacked‚Äù changes, like you‚Äôd see with a <code>[1/X]</code> thread on the Linux kernel mailing list.  But they all focus on having code review itself take place on the forge‚Äôs web site, as opposed to (for instance) on a mailing list.</p>

<p>That, in turn, makes the project maintainers and contributors internalize the idea that the forge‚Äôs unit of <em>review</em> should be the same as the project‚Äôs unit of <em>change</em> and <em>history</em>.  And that is the difference in mindset.  Zach Holman has the <a href="https://zachholman.com/posts/git-commit-history/">best summary</a> I‚Äôve found so far.</p>

<p>If you view the PR as your unit of change, then you apply all of the same best practices, but in a different place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong><em>PR</em></strong> should introduce exactly one change, of the correct size.</li>
  <li>The <strong><em>PR title and body</em></strong> should contain a description of that change, structured and formatted in a very similar way to Tim Pope‚Äôs git commit message recommendations.</li>
  <li>The test suite must pass <strong><em>for the final state of the PR</em></strong> before it can be merged into the main branch.</li>
</ul>

<p>But as Zach calls out, you end up ‚Äúnot giving two shits‚Äù about the individual git commits that make up your PRs.</p>

<p>(To be clear, I am <strong><em>not</em></strong> advocating this mindset, but I was happy to find a good post <em>explaining</em> it.  It‚Äôs still like fingernails on a chalkboard to come across a project that‚Äôs organized this way.  But the ‚ÄúPR as unit of change‚Äù explanation at least means that I can now see that it <em>is</em> a consistent organizing principle, even if it‚Äôs not one I agree with.)</p>

<p>In my original post I suggest that if you use GitHub PRs as your unit of review, and want to use git commits as your unit of history, then you must make sure to use the ‚Äúsquash merge‚Äù feature when merging your PRs.  This reduces each PR-as-unit-of-review into a single commit-as-unit-of-history at merge time.  (If you‚Äôre happy to <em>mindfully</em> decide to use PRs as both your unit of review <em>and</em> your unit of history, then you can use whatever merge strategy you want.)  It‚Äôs still unsolved how best to use PRs to review a ‚Äústack‚Äù of changes, that should end up as separate commits in the history, but which should be reviewed as a unit (or as a closely reviewed sequence).</p>

      <p>In the <a href="../s0/">previous post</a>, we described S‚ÇÄ, and showed how it would be
<strong><em>absolutely disgusting</em></strong> to have to program in it directly.  Which is why I
described it as Swanson‚Äôs ‚Äúassembly language‚Äù.  In this post, we‚Äôll look into
exactly <em>how</em> the language is complicated, and use that to describe a <em>slightly</em>
better language named S‚ÇÅ.</p>

      <h1><a href="/staff-engineering-manager/">Staff engineering manager</a></h1>
      <p>I‚Äôve been promoted!  As of January 1st, I will now be a Staff Engineering Manager at GitHub.</p>

<p>This is a new title on our career ladder, which was only added in the last couple of months.  Prior to this, the next promotion on the manager track would have been to Director.  The ‚ÄúDirector‚Äù title, however, usually implies that you are no longer a line manager, and are instead a manager of managers.  You‚Äôre in charge of a larger group, consisting of a number of distinct teams.  As the Director of the group, you achieve impact by how your teams can work on a number of things in parallel.</p>

<p>For my own career progression, that left me with a difficult decision.  I joined GitHub specifically to work with the Semantic Code team, applying interesting program analysis ideas from research to create useful developer productivity features.  I‚Äôm still very invested in the people on this team, and the problems we‚Äôre trying to solve.  But working with a single team doesn‚Äôt line up well with the ‚ÄúDirector‚Äù title, at least as it‚Äôs defined on our career ladder.  So going for a promotion would have realistically required moving to another part of the company, working on technology and product features that I‚Äôm less interested in.</p>

<p>We added the Staff Engineering Manager title to the career ladder specifically to address this discrepancy.  It allows me to progress in my career while still being the line manager of a single team.  I still have to show higher impact now with this new title.  And like on the IC ladder, ‚Äústaff‚Äù implies that your impact needs to be cross-team in some way.</p>

<p>But so far ‚Äî having not yet spent even a single day with my new title ‚Äî it seems like a great fit!</p>

into S‚ÇÄ.  We‚Äôll see in later posts how this process works.  For now, don‚Äôt be

      <h1><a href="/swanson/intro/">Introduction</a></h1>
      <p>My <a href="https://twitter.com/dcreager">Twitter bio</a> currently lists me as (among
other things) a ‚ÄúPL dilettante‚Äù.  Which of course means that I‚Äôve been hacking
around on my own programming language for a number of years!  (Seriously, this
has been a thing for a <strong><em>long</em></strong> time.  The earliest <a href="https://github.com/swanson-lang/swanson-lang-old/commit/e8aac263d76a63c8667fca5eee079ce8af345c2d">Swanson-related
commit</a> I can find is from 2012.)  It‚Äôs gone through a number of
iterations over that time, but I‚Äôm pretty happy with where it‚Äôs at right now.
Not complete by any stretch of the imagination.  But I‚Äôve chatted about it in
passing with several people at this point, and I figured I need to write down
the details somewhere.  My friend and colleague Rob can hold forth on these
kinds of topics in <a href="https://twitter.com/rob_rix/status/1320544724864872453">epic</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/rob_rix/status/1320488333127110659">Twitter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/rob_rix/status/1320467572161236994">threads</a>, but I need
something more longform.  So here we are!</p>

<p>In this series of posts I‚Äôm going to describe Swanson, the programming language
framework that I‚Äôve been noodling on.  It has two main components, one of which
is much more fleshed out than the other.</p>

<p>The first (not as fleshed out) part is an actual programming language, which
doesn‚Äôt even really have a name yet!  It brings in some interesting notions
about programmable syntax and parsing in a way that (I think) makes it easy to
construct things like DSLs.</p>

<p>The second (more important) part is an execution model that can be used as an IR
of sorts for <strong><em>all</em></strong> languages.  That makes it similar in spirit to
WebAssembly, in that the goal is to be something that you would compile (or
translate or transpile or whatever) many other languages <strong><em>into</em></strong>, and not
something to be written directly.  The Great Unnamed Language, like any other
language, would be compiled into Swanson the execution framework.</p>

<p>A couple of recent tweets really resonated me.</p>

<p><a href="https://adityamukerjee.net/">Aditya</a> started an interesting conversation:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you&#39;d asked me a few weeks ago whether I preferred squash-merges or merge commits, I&#39;d have been somewhat ambivalent.<br /><br />After today, I&#39;m pretty sold on squash-merge as the better strategy. It&#39;s not without drawbacks, but on net, it&#39;s still so much better to work with.</p>&mdash; Aditya Mukerjee (@chimeracoder) <a href="https://twitter.com/chimeracoder/status/986376765567356928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 17, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôve always really liked having a ‚Äúclean‚Äù history in the git logs of my
projects.  They look nicer!  There‚Äôs a real joy to running <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log"><code>git log</code></a> (or
even better, <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log"><code>git log --graph --all</code></a>!) on a project that‚Äôs
maintained a beautiful log.  There are a number of tangible benefits, too, which
<a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">others</a> <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/appendix/best-practices">have</a> <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/TarinGamberini/commit-messages-goodpractices">described</a> well enough that I
don‚Äôt need to repeat them here.</p>

<p>More than that, though, for a long time I assumed that if you were using GitHub
pull requests, there was One True Way to produce a clean history, echoed by
<a href="https://sevein.com/">Jes√∫s</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Best merges to me are the fast-forward merges that bring a number of meaninful, atomic, functional and self-contained commits! Not always possible...</p>&mdash; Jes√∫s Garc√≠a Crespo (@sevein) <a href="https://twitter.com/sevein/status/986412919964368896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>But recently, just like Aditya, I‚Äôve had a change of heart!  I realized that I
was thinking about pull requests, and what they represent in terms of the final
commit log I‚Äôm aiming for, in the wrong way.  In this post I‚Äôll describe the
come-to-Aditya moment that made me appreciate squash-commits.  And along the way
I‚Äôll have described two workflows that make it easy to keep a clean history: one
that doesn‚Äôt use GitHub at all (and mimics how we did git-driven development
before GitHub existed), and one that does.</p>
