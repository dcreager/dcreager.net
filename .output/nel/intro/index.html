          <h1>Introducing Network Error Logging</h1>
          <p>Let’s say you’ve got a web site or REST service.  You have clients that send
requests to your server, which performs some interesting processing and sends
responses back.  The clients might be people using a browser, or native code in
a mobile app making requests on behalf of the user, or something more exotic.
But the overall picture is the same:</p>

<p><img src="/nel/intro/service-flow.png" alt="request service flow" class="figure" /></p>

<p>How do you monitor this service — especially when that annoying cloudy bit in
the middle is completely out of your control?</p>

<hr class="jump" />

<style>
.log {
  border-radius: 0;
  font-size: 11px;
  padding: 6px;
  margin: 3em 0;
}

.actor {
  width: 10em;
  margin-right: 20px;
  margin-top: 1.5em;
  margin-bottom: 1em;
  float: left;
}
</style>

<p>Server logs are a great source of information, and are typically part of the
answer.  Your server creates a record for every single connection attempt that
it receives, including information about the client, the resource they
requested, and whether or not the request succeeded:</p>

<p>There are a couple of interesting wrinkles.  First, how do you get at those
server logs?  Your web server will typically write those to disk on the machine
that it’s running on, so you need to somehow copy the contents of the logs to
whatever monitoring or observability platform you’re using.  (When you’re first
starting off, you can get away with manually logging into the servers and
grepping through the files directly, but that doesn’t scale as you add machines
or developers.)  This isn’t an unsolvable problem, but it does add some
operational complexity to your setup.</p>

<p>More interesting is that your server logs don’t have visibility into all of the
problems that your clients might encounter — especially those that involve the
network!  Since the network isn’t under your control, you have to consider it a
black box: your client puts requests into one side, and hopefully those requests
come out the other side at your server.</p>

<p>To have an end-to-end view of your request traffic, you need to instrument the
client side of the connection, too.  Have it record every time it attempts a
request:</p>

<p><img src="/nel/intro/client.png" alt="client" class="actor" /></p>

<pre class="log">
2018-03-26 03:04:04 https://example.com/about/ ⇒ 200
2018-03-26 03:04:16 https://example.com/login/ ⇒ 200
2018-03-26 03:05:13 https://example.com/contact/ ⇒ 200
2018-03-26 03:05:47 https://example.com/directions/ ⇒ 200
2018-03-26 03:10:50 https://example.com/menu/ ⇒ 200
2018-03-26 03:12:02 https://example.com/specials/ ⇒ 200
</pre>

<p>Then send those records to the same analysis platform that you send the server
logs to.  If there’s a record that appears on the client side, but not on the
server side, then you’ve found an interesting case where the network dropped
your connection!  (The next step is to figure out <strong>why</strong> the connection was
dropped, which is a topic worthy of its own post.)</p>

<p>When you have control over the client code (for instance, writing native code
for a mobile app), this is pretty doable.  Most of the libraries that you’d use
to make those HTTP requests provide all of the necessary hooks to add in this
kind of instrumentation.  Of course, that’s one more bit of operational coding
that takes you away from working on your actual service.</p>

<p>This also works if you’re trying to monitor a site or service that is accessed
from a browser.  You’d attach custom JavaScript callbacks to <code>onerror</code> events,
for instance, and check for errors on manual <code>fetch</code> requests.  It’s a bit
tedious, but definitely doable.  But there are two ways that this can fall over:</p>

<p>First, there are some browser-initiated requests that don’t provide the hooks
that you need (navigation requests, for instance).  There’s no amount of
client-side coding that can give you visibility into these requests.</p>

<p>More interestingly, it’s the site that <strong>initiates</strong> the request that would get
to see these events, not the origin that <strong>receives</strong> them.  For instance, if
you’ve written a popular REST API that lots of sites decide to use, you really
want to instrument <strong>all</strong> uses of your API, without requiring those sites to do
any manual work.  You could provide a JavaScript wrapper API that instruments
every request that it makes, but what about the request to download that
JavaScript code?  What if it fails?  The site that uses your API would have
visibility into that failure, but you, the API author, and the person best
placed to fix the problem, would not!</p>

<p>Given all of these issues, wouldn’t it be nice if the browser or HTTP library
would do all of this client-side monitoring work for you?</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://wicg.github.io/network-error-logging/">Network Error Logging</a> (NEL), a new web platform spec that we’re
working on in the W3C’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/webperf/">Web Performance Working Group</a>.  With NEL, you
can instruct user agents to collect the same set of information that would
appear in your server logs.  Those instructions would apply to <strong>all</strong> requests
to your server’s origin, regardless of how (and on which containing sites) those
requests were initiated.  And since the data is collected directly by the user
agent, you should have visibility into <strong>all</strong> of your clients’ connection
requests, not just those that made it to your serving infrastructure.</p>

<p>NEL is still in its early stages.  We have what we think is a good initial
draft, and we’re wrapping up proof-of-concept implementations (both in the
browser and in a handful of HTTP request libraries).  But we’d love to hear
feedback.  Do you have any interesting outages that NEL would’ve given you
better visibility into?  Is there anything you think we’ve missed?  Let me know
through <a href="/about/">the usual channels</a> or by filing an issue on <a href="https://github.com/wicg/network-error-logging">our Github
repo</a>.</p>
