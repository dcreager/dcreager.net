      GitHub has recently added Code Navigation features (jump to definition and
      find all references) that let you navigate code directly on <a
        href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.  For the languages that we
      support, we extract and store symbol information for every named branch
      and tag, of every repository, public or private, with no configuration
      necessary. The compute and storage requirements to do this for all of the
      code on GitHub are quite large. In this talk, we'll discuss some of the
      trade-offs we've made to make this tractable at GitHub's scale, to be able
      to operate and monitor this service effectively, and to let us add support
      for new languages quickly and easily. We'll also talk about our ongoing
      work to extend Code Navigation to handle links that cross package and
      repository boundaries.

      The early 2000's saw several research groups look into distributed hash
      tables as a decentralized way to structure a distributed system. In this
      talk, I'll briefly describe some of the history behind DHTs, and look at
      one of them in particular: Pastry, which takes into account how close or
      far apart nodes are from each other when constructing the peer-to-peer
      overlay network. We'll also look at Scribe, which implements
      anycast/multicast messaging on top of the Pastry overlay network.

      Your application depends on the network more than you might realize.  Are
      you monitoring it?  A performance problem in the network is a performance
      problem for your app.  A reliability problem in the network is a
      reliability problem for your app.
      </p>

      <p>
      At Google, we have instrumented several parts of our serving stack to
      collect detailed information about the network.  An important part of that
      is a real-time pipeline for collecting and analyzing packet captures,
      which give you detailed diagnostics about individual network connections.
      In this talk you'll learn how to visualize and analyze packet captures to
      detect network problems that affect what your users experience.

      Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) was first described by Tony Hoare
      in 1978.  Since then, there have been two main "branches" of further
      development.  In the first branch, CSP inspired how concurrency is handled
      in an ongoing series of programming languages — most recently (and
      famously) in Go.  In the second branch, CSP was refined into a rigorous
      “process calculus”, and has since been used to formally prove various
      safety and liveness properties of concurrent and distributed systems.
      </p>

      <p>
      This talk will be a whirlwind history of CSP, a high-level overview of the
      process calculus, and some live demos of using a refinement checker to
      prove things about interesting systems.  (No proving things by hand!)

      History! Those who don't know it are doomed to etc.
      </p>

      <p>
      Smalltalk is one of the earliest object-oriented languages. It's extremely
      influential — many of the OO concepts that we use in today's languages
      were first developed in Smalltalk. But what influenced Smalltalk? Alan Kay
      will walk us through the language's inspirations in this talk, including
      such crazy new technologies as UIs with overlapping windows and a
      1970's-era ur-tablet!

      This talk was an overview of the Apache Avro data serialization framework.
      It includes some detail on why you'd want to use a framework of its kind
      instead of XML, JSON, or rolling your own custom format.
