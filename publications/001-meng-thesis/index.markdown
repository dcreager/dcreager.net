## Abstract

The Open Microscopy Environment (OME) provides a standardized, open-
source environment in which microscope images can be acquired,
analyzed, and visualized.  The OME analysis system provides a modular
architecture for analyzing these images.  Analysis routines are broken
down into their logical components, which are coded separately as
modules.  Modules are linked together into analysis chains by using
semantic data types to form data dependencies between the modules.
Tools are being developed to allow these chains to be pieced together
graphically from a toolbox of analysis modules, and to allow the user
to extend the toolbox in a seamless, language-independent manner.  The
execution of an analysis routine against a set of images is automated,
allowing the user to focus on the design of the analysis routine,
rather than the details of computation, and allowing the analysis
engine to perform various optimizations, such as the reuse of analysis
results.
