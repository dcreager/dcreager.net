# Starting a Gemlog

I've always had a hard time keeping up with my traditional Web blog — I think because I always feel like I need to “polish up” a post before it's really ready to publish!

And several series of posts that start off with an “Introduction” and a single meaty section, and then taper off into nothingness.
