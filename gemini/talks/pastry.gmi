# The Pastry peer-to-peer overlay network

Papers We Love, Boston-Cambridge chapter, July 2018

The early 2000’s saw several research groups look into distributed hash tables as a decentralized way to structure a distributed system. In this talk, I’ll briefly describe some of the history behind DHTs, and look at one of them in particular: Pastry, which takes into account how close or far apart nodes are from each other when constructing the peer-to-peer overlay network. We’ll also look at Scribe, which implements anycast/multicast messaging on top of the Pastry overlay network.
