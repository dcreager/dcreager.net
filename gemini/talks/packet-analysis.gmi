# Real-time packet analysis at scale

Monitorama PDX, May 2017

Your application depends on the network more than you might realize.  Are you monitoring it?  A performance problem in the network is a performance problem for your app.  A reliability problem in the network is a reliability problem for your app.

At Google, we have instrumented several parts of our serving stack to collect detailed information about the network.  An important part of that is a real-time pipeline for collecting and analyzing packet captures, which give you detailed diagnostics about individual network connections.  In this talk youâ€™ll learn how to visualize and analyze packet captures to detect network problems that affect what your users experience.
